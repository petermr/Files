        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Terpenoids are among the most important constituents of grape flavour and wine bouquet, and serve as useful metabolite markers in viticulture and enology. Based on the initial 8-fold sequencing of a nearly homozygous Pinot noir inbred line, 89 putative terpenoid synthase genes (VvTPS) were predicted by in silico analysis of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera) genome assembly 1. The finding of this very large VvTPS family, combined with the importance of terpenoid metabolism for the organoleptic properties of grapevine berries and finished wines, prompted a detailed examination of this gene family at the genomic level as well as an investigation into VvTPS biochemical functions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We present findings from the analysis of the up-dated 12-fold sequencing and assembly of the grapevine genome that place the number of predicted VvTPS genes at 69 putatively functional VvTPS, 20 partial VvTPS, and 63 VvTPS probable pseudogenes. Gene discovery and annotation included information about gene architecture and chromosomal location. A dense cluster of 45 VvTPS is localized on chromosome 18. Extensive FLcDNA cloning, gene synthesis, and protein expression enabled functional characterization of 39 VvTPS; this is the largest number of functionally characterized TPS for any species reported to date. Of these enzymes, 23 have unique functions and/or phylogenetic locations within the plant TPS gene family. Phylogenetic analyses of the TPS gene family showed that while most VvTPS form species-specific gene clusters, there are several examples of gene orthology with TPS of other plant species, representing perhaps more ancient VvTPS, which have maintained functions independent of speciation.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The highly expanded VvTPS gene family underpins the prominence of terpenoid metabolism in grapevine. We provide a detailed experimental functional annotation of 39 members of this important gene family in grapevine and comprehensive information about gene structure and phylogeny for the entire currently known VvTPS gene family.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;In conifers, terpene synthases (TPSs) of the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily form a diverse array of mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenoid compounds, which are components of the oleoresin secretions and volatile emissions. These compounds contribute to defence against herbivores and pathogens and perhaps also protect against abiotic stress.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The availability of extensive transcriptome resources in the form of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length cDNAs in several spruce (Picea) species allowed us to estimate that a conifer genome contains at least 69 unique and transcriptionally active TPS genes. This number is comparable to the number of TPSs found in any of the sequenced and well-annotated angiosperm genomes. We functionally characterized a total of 21 spruce TPSs: 12 from Sitka spruce (P. sitchensis), 5 from white spruce (P. glauca), and 4 from hybrid white spruce (P. glauca Ã— P. engelmannii), which included 15 monoterpene synthases, 4 sesquiterpene synthases, and 2 diterpene synthases.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The functional diversity of these characterized TPSs parallels the diversity of terpenoids found in the oleoresin and volatile emissions of Sitka spruce and provides a context for understanding this chemical diversity at the molecular and mechanistic levels. The comparative characterization of Sitka spruce and Norway spruce diterpene synthases revealed the natural occurrence of TPS sequence variants between closely related spruce species, confirming a previous prediction from site-directed mutagenesis and modelling.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Laser microdissection (LMD) has been established for isolation of individual tissue types from herbaceous plants. However, there are few reports of cell- and tissue-specific analysis in woody perennials. While microdissected tissues are commonly analyzed for gene expression, reports of protein, enzyme activity and metabolite analysis are limited due in part to an inability to amplify these molecules. Conifer stem tissues are organized in regular patterns with xylem, phloem and cortex development controlled by the activity of the cambial zone (CZ). Defense responses of conifer stems against insects and pathogens involve increased accumulation of terpenoids in cortical resin ducts (CRDs) and de novo formation of traumatic resin ducts from CZ initials. These tissues are difficult to isolate for tissue-specific molecular and biochemical characterization and are thus good targets for application of LMD.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We describe robust methods for isolation of individual tissue-types from white spruce (Picea glauca) stems for analysis of RNA, enzyme activity and metabolites. A tangential cryosectioning approach was important for obtaining large quantities of CRD and CZ tissues using LMD. We report differential expression of genes involved in terpenoid metabolism between CRD and CZ tissues and in response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Transcript levels of beta-pinene synthase and levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase were constitutively higher in CRDs, but induction was stronger in CZ in response to MeJA. 3-Carene synthase was more strongly induced in CRDs compared to CZ. A differential induction pattern was observed for 1-deoxyxyulose-5-phosphate synthase, which was up-regulated in CRDs and down-regulated in CZ. We identified terpene synthase enzyme activity in CZ protein extracts and terpenoid metabolites in both CRD and CZ tissues.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Methods are described that allow for analysis of RNA, enzyme activity and terpenoid metabolites in individual tissues isolated by LMD from woody conifer stems. Patterns of gene expression are demonstrated in specific tissues that may be masked in analysis of heterogeneous samples. Combined analysis of transcripts, proteins and metabolites of individual tissues will facilitate future characterization of complex processes of woody plant development, including periodic stem growth and dormancy, cell specialization, and defense and may be applied widely to other plant species.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The essential oil of chamomile, one of the oldest and agronomically most important medicinal plant species in Europe, has significant antiphlogistic, spasmolytic and antimicrobial activities. It is rich in chamazulene, a pharmaceutically active compound spontaneously formed during steam distillation from the sesquiterpene lactone matricine. Chamomile oil also contains sesquiterpene alcohols and hydrocarbons which are produced by the action of terpene synthases (TPS), the key enzymes in constructing terpene carbon skeletons.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Here, we present the identification and characterization of five TPS enzymes contributing to terpene biosynthesis in chamomile (Matricaria recutita). Four of these enzymes were exclusively expressed in above-ground organs and produced the common terpene hydrocarbons (-)-(E)-Î²-caryophyllene (MrTPS1), (+)-germacrene A (MrTPS3), (E)-Î²-ocimene (MrTPS4) and (-)-germacrene D (MrTPS5). A fifth TPS, the multiproduct enzyme MrTPS2, was mainly expressed in roots and formed several Asteraceae-specific tricyclic sesquiterpenes with (-)-Î±-isocomene being the major product. The TPS transcript accumulation patterns in different organs of chamomile were consistent with the abundance of the corresponding TPS products isolated from these organs suggesting that the spatial regulation of TPS gene expression qualitatively contribute to terpene composition.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The terpene synthases characterized in this study are involved in the organ-specific formation of essential oils in chamomile. While the products of MrTPS1, MrTPS2, MrTPS4 and MrTPS5 accumulate in the oils without further chemical alterations, (+)-germacrene A produced by MrTPS3 accumulates only in trace amounts, indicating that it is converted into another compound like matricine. Thus, MrTPS3, but also the other TPS genes, are good markers for further breeding of chamomile cultivars rich in pharmaceutically active essential oils.">

Systematic mutagenesis studies have been effective in providing insights into the characteristic and complex mechanisms of C-C bond formations and in exploring the enzymatic potential for inventing new chemical structures. In addition, there is growing demand to increase terpene synthase activity in heterologous hosts, given the maturation of metabolic engineering and host breeding for terpenoid synthesis. We have developed a simple screening method for the cellular activities of terpene synthases by scoring their substrate consumption based on the color loss of the cell harboring carotenoid pathways. We demonstrate that this method can be used to detect activities of various terpene synthase or prenyltransferase genes in a high-throughput manner, irrespective of the product type, enabling the mutation analysis and directed evolution of terpene synthases. We also report the possibility for substrate-specific screening system of terpene synthases by taking advantage of the substrate-size specificity of C30 and C40 carotenoid pathways.">

Quantitative and qualitative inter- and intra- specific variation of terpenes is common in eucalypts.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The genome sequences of Eucalyptus grandis and E. globulus were mined for terpene synthase genes (TPS) and compared to other plant species. We investigated the relative expression of TPS in seven plant tissues and functionally characterized five TPS genes from E. grandis. Compared to other sequenced plant genomes, Eucalyptus grandis has the largest number of putative functional TPS genes of any sequenced plant. We discovered 113 and 106 putative functional TPS genes in E. grandis and E. globulus, respectively. All but one TPS from E. grandis were expressed in at least one of seven plant tissues examined. Genomic clusters of up to 20 genes were identified. Many TPS are expressed in tissues other than leaves which invites a re-evaluation of the function of terpenes in Eucalyptus.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our data indicate that terpenes in Eucalyptus may play a wider role in biotic and abiotic interactions than previously thought. Tissue specific expression is common and the possibility of stress induction needs further investigation. Phylogenetic comparison of the two investigated Eucalyptus species gives insight about recent evolution of different clades within the TPS gene family. While the majority of TPS genes occur in orthologous pairs some clades show evidence of recent gene duplication, as well as loss of function.">

        <span class="abst" title="Osmanthus fragrans is an ornamental and economically important plant known for its magnificent aroma, and the most important aroma-active compounds in flowers are monoterpenes, mainly Î²-ocimene, linalool and linalool derivatives. To understand the molecular mechanism of monoterpene production, we analyzed the emission and accumulation patterns of these compounds and the transcript levels of the genes involved in their biosynthesis in two O. fragrans cultivars during flowering stages. The results showed that both emission and accumulation of monoterpenes varied with flower development and glycosylation had an important impact on floral linalool emission during this process. Gene expression demonstrated that the transcript levels of terpene synthase (TPS) genes probably played a key role in monoterpene production, compared to the genes in the MEP pathway. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OfTPS1 and OfTPS2 belonged to a TPS-g subfamily, and OfTPS3 and OfTPS4 clustered into a TPS-b subfamily. Their transient and stable expression in tobacco leaves suggested that OfTPS1 and OfTPS2 exclusively produced Î²-linalool, and trans-Î²-ocimene was the sole product from OfTPS3, while OfTPS4, a predictive sesquiterpene synthase, produced Î±-farnesene. These results indicate that OfTPS1, OfTPS2, and OfTPS3 could account for the major floral monoterpenes, linalool and trans-Î²-ocimene, produced in O. fragrans flowers.">

Sodorifen (IUPAC name: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8-heptamethyl-3-methylenebicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene) is a recently identified and unusual volatile hydrocarbon that is emitted by the rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica 4RÃ—13. Sodorifen comprises a bicyclic ring structure solely consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, where every carbon atom of the skeleton is substituted with either a methyl or a methylene group. This unusual feature of sodorifen made a prediction of its biosynthetic origin very difficult and so far its biosynthesis is unknown. To unravel the biosynthetic pathway we performed genome and transcriptome analyses to identify candidate genes. One knockout mutant (SOD_c20750) showed the desired negative sodorifen phenotype. Here it was shown for the first time that this gene is indispensable for the synthesis of sodorifen and strongly supports the hypothesis that sodorifen descends from the terpene metabolism. SOD_c20750 is the first bacterial terpene cyclase isolated from Serratia spp. and Enterobacteriales. Homology modeling revealed a 3D structure, which exhibits a functional role of amino acids for intermediate cation stabilization (W325) and putative proton acception (Y332). Moreover, the size and hydrophobicity of the active site strongly indicates that indeed the enzyme may catalyze the unusual compound sodorifen.">

Map-based cloning was initiated using a set of isogenic lines (ILs) harboring the major Bph3 locus on chromosome 6. IL genomes were scanned with a 57 K Affymetrix Rice GeneChip to identify the gene responsible for Bph3.&lt;h4&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;Single-feature polymorphism (SFP) mapping was used to localize 84 candidate genes. An expression analysis of 15 selected candidate genes in the aromatic rice cultivar KDML105 (KD) and the ILs under normal conditions revealed two differentially expressed sequences. Following hopper feeding, only one candidate gene, Os04g27430, was differentially expressed. Os04g27430 encodes a putative sesquiterpene synthase (STPS) gene that was induced by BPH feeding in ILs. An antixenosis test in three selected ILs revealed a major role for STPS in insect preference during the first 120 hours of the rice-insect interaction. Functional SNPs in exon 5 that resulted in the deletion of seven amino acids in the susceptible rice line were identified. Moreover, three additional SNPs associated with three transcription binding sites were also identified, which might explain the differential response of Os04g27430 during the anti-feeding test.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Os04g27430 is the second known rice STPS induced by BPH. The gene may involve an antixenosis BPH resistance mechanism. The combination of the STPS and the Bph3 locus was more effective than Bph3 alone in the tested ILs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plant terpene synthases (TPSs) are key enzymes responsible for terpene biosynthesis, and can play important roles in defense against herbivore attack. In rice, the protein sequence of TPS46 was most closely related to maize TPS10. However, unlike maize &lt;i&gt;tps10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tps46&lt;/i&gt; was also constitutively expressed in rice even in the absence of herbivore attack. Potential roles or constitutive emissions of specific volatiles may due to the constitutive expressions of &lt;i&gt;tps&lt;/i&gt;46 in rice. Therefore, in the present study, RNA interference (Ri) and overexpression (Oe) rice lines were generated to investigate the potential function of TPS46 in &lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; sp. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, the rice plants become more susceptible to &lt;i&gt;Rhopalosiphum padi&lt;/i&gt; when expression of &lt;i&gt;tps&lt;/i&gt;46 was silenced compared with Wt in greenhouse conditions. Artificial infestation bioassays further confirmed that Ri rice lines were susceptible to &lt;i&gt;R. padi&lt;/i&gt;, whereas Oe rice lines were repellent to &lt;i&gt;R. padi&lt;/i&gt;. Based on GC-MS and ToF-MS analysis, a total of eight volatile products catalyzed by TPS46 in rice were identified. Among them, only limonene and EÎ²f could be detected in all the Ri, Oe, and Wt lines, whereas other six volatiles were only found in the blend of volatiles from Oe lines. Moreover, the amount of constitutive limonene and EÎ²f in the Ri lines was significantly lower than in Wt lines, while the amounts of these two volatiles in the Oe line were obviously higher than in control rice. Our data suggested that the constitutive emissions of EÎ²f and limonene regulated by the constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;tps&lt;/i&gt;46 may play a crucial role in rice defense against &lt;i&gt;R. padi.&lt;/i&gt; Consequently, &lt;i&gt;tps&lt;/i&gt;46 could be a potential target gene to be employed for improving the resistance of plants to aphids.">

Here, the AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene response factor) transcription factor, CitAP2.10, is characterized as a regulator of (+)-valencene synthesis. The expression pattern of CitAP2.10 was positively correlated with (+)-valencene content and CsTPS1 expression. Dual-luciferase assays indicated that CitAP2.10 could trans-activate the CsTPS1 promoter. Ethylene enhanced expression of CitAP2.10 and this effect was abolished by the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene. The role and function of CitAP2.10 in (+)-valencene biosynthesis were confirmed using the Arabidopsis homolog (AtWRI1), which also transiently activated the CsTPS1 promoter. Furthermore, transient over-expression of CitAP2.10 triggered (+)-valencene biosynthesis in sweet orange fruit. These results indicate that CitAP2.10 regulates (+)-valencene synthesis via induction of CsTPS1 mRNA accumulation.">

Braz1006-TPS23 was heterologously expressed in &lt;i&gt;E.Â coli&lt;/i&gt;, and amino acid sequences were determined. Furthermore, electrophysiological and behavioral responses of a key parasitic wasp &lt;i&gt;Cotesia sesamiae&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;.Â &lt;i&gt;partellus&lt;/i&gt; egg-induced Braz1006 volatiles were determined using coupled gas chromatography electroantennography and olfactometer bioassay studies. After elicitor treatment, Braz1006 released eightfold higher (&lt;i&gt;E)&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene than Delprim, whereas no (&lt;i&gt;E)&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene was detected in B73. The superior &lt;i&gt;(E)-&lt;/i&gt;caryophyllene production by Braz1006 was positively correlated with high transcript levels of TPS23 in the landrace compared to Delprim. TPS23 alleles from Braz1006 showed dissimilarities at different sequence positions with Delprim and B73 and encodes an active enzyme. &lt;i&gt;Cotesia sesamiae&lt;/i&gt; was attracted to egg-induced volatiles from Braz1006 and synthetic &lt;i&gt;(E)-&lt;/i&gt;caryophyllene. The variation in (&lt;i&gt;E)&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene emission between Braz1006 and Delprim is positively correlated with induced levels of TPS23 transcripts. The enhanced TPS23 activity and corresponding (&lt;i&gt;E)&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene production by the maize landrace could be attributed to the differences in amino acid sequence with the other maize lines. This study suggested that the same analogous genes could have contrasting expression patterns in different maize genetic backgrounds. The current findings provide valuable insight not only into genetic mechanisms underlying variation in defense signal production but also the prospect of introgressing the novel defense traits into elite maize varieties for effective and ecologically sound protection of crops against damaging insect pests.">

Accumulated in secretory cavities, most components of these oils are volatile terpenes. They contribute to defense against herbivores and pathogens, and perhaps also protect tissues against abiotic stress. In spite of their importance, our understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and genetic regulation of citrus terpene volatiles is still limited. The availability of the sweet orange (&lt;i&gt;Citrus sinensis&lt;/i&gt; L. Osbeck) genome sequence allowed us to characterize for the first time the terpene synthase (TPS) family in a citrus type. &lt;i&gt;CsTPS&lt;/i&gt; is one of the largest angiosperm TPS families characterized so far, formed by 95 loci from which just 55 encode for putative functional TPSs. All TPS angiosperm families, TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-e/f, and TPS-g were represented in the sweet orange genome, with 28, 18, 2, 2, and 5 putative full length genes each. Additionally, sweet orange Î²-farnesene synthase, (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-Î²-cubebene/Î±-copaene synthase, two Î²-caryophyllene synthases, and three multiproduct enzymes yielding Î²-cadinene/Î±-copaene, Î²-elemene, and Î²-cadinene/ledene/allo-aromandendrene as major products were identified, and functionally characterized via &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recombinant &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; assays.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenes are an important group of secondary metabolites in carrots influencing taste and flavor, and some of them might also play a role as bioactive substances with an impact on human physiology and health. Understanding the genetic and molecular basis of terpene synthases (TPS) involved in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids will provide insights for improving breeding strategies aimed at quality traits and for developing specific carrot chemotypes possibly useful for pharmaceutical applications. Hence, a combination of terpene metabolite profiling, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), and genome-wide association study (GWAS) was used in this work to get insights into the genetic control of terpene biosynthesis in carrots and to identify several TPS candidate genes that might be involved in the production of specific monoterpenes. In a panel of 85 carrot cultivars and accessions, metabolite profiling was used to identify 31 terpenoid volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in carrot leaves and roots, and a GBS approach was used to provide dense genome-wide marker coverage (&gt;168,000 SNPs). Based on this data, a total of 30 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) was identified for 15 terpenoid volatiles. Most QTLs were detected for the monoterpene compounds ocimene, sabinene, Î²-pinene, borneol and bornyl acetate. We identified four genomic regions on three different carrot chromosomes by GWAS which are both associated with high significance (LOD â‰¥ 5.91) to distinct monoterpenes and to TPS candidate genes, which have been identified by homology-based gene prediction utilizing RNA-seq data. In total, 65 TPS candidate gene models in carrot were identified and assigned to known plant TPS subfamilies with the exception of TPS-d and TPS-h. TPS-b was identified as largest subfamily with 32 TPS candidate genes.">

For example, there are two plausible reaction pathways for sesterfisherol biosynthesis, which differ in the order of ring cyclization: A-D-B/C (Path a) and A-B-C/D (Path b). It is difficult to capture intermediates of terpene cyclization, which is a complex, domino-type reaction, and so here we employed a combination of experimental and computational methods. Density functional theory calculations revealed unexpected intermediates and transition states, and implied that C-HÂ·Â·Â·Ï€ interaction between a carbocation intermediate and an aromatic residue of sesterfisherol synthase (NfSS) plays a critical role, serving to accelerate the 1,2-H shift (thereby preventing triquinane carbocation formation) and to protect reactive carbocation intermediates from bases such as pyrophosphate or water in the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis of NfSS guided by docking simulations confirmed that phenylalanine F191 is a critical amino acid residue for sesterfisherol synthase, as the F191A mutant of NfSS produces novel sesterterpenes, but not sesterfisherol. Although both pathways are energetically viable, on the basis of our computational and experimental results, NfSS-mediated sesterfisherol biosynthesis appears to proceed via Path a. These findings may also provide new insight into the cyclization mechanisms in related sesterterpene synthases.">

The monoterpene E-geraniol is an important volatile, contributing to flavor in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck). Moreover, antifungal activity of E-geraniol has also been observed. However, the terpene synthase (TPS) responsible for its synthesis has not been identified in sweet orange. Terpene synthase 16 (CitTPS16) was shown to catalyze synthesis of E-geraniol in vitro, and transient overexpression of CitTPS16 in fruits and leaves of Newhall sweet orange resulted in E-geraniol accumulation in vivo. Having identified the responsible enzyme, we next examined transcriptional regulation of CitTPS16 in the fruit. Among cloned members of the AP2/ERF transcription factor gene family, CitERF71 showed a similar expression pattern to CitTPS16. Moreover, CitERF71 was able to activate the CitTPS16 promoter based on results from transient dual-luciferase assays and yeast one-hybrid assays. EMSAs showed that CitERF71 directly binds to ACCCGCC and GGCGGG motifs in the CitTPS16 promoter. These results indicate an important role for CitERF71 in transcriptional regulation of CitTP16 and, therefore, in controlling production of E-geraniol in Citrus fruit.">

With this study we discover a broad spectrum of novel terpenoids with eleven carbon atoms as byproducts of bacterial 2-methylisoborneol or 2-methylenebornane synthases. Both enzymes use 2-methyl-GPP as substrate, which is synthesized from GPP by the action of a methyltransferase. We used E. coli strains that heterologously produce different C11-terpene synthases together with the GPP methyltransferase and the mevalonate pathway enzymes. With this de novo approach, 35 different C11-terpenes could be produced. In addition to eleven known compounds, it was possible to detect 24 novel C11-terpenes which have not yet been described as terpene synthase products. Four of them, 3,4-dimethylcumene, 2-methylborneol and the two diastereomers of 2-methylcitronellol could be identified. Furthermore, we showed that an E. coli strain expressing the GPP-methyltransferase can produce the C16-terpene 6-methylfarnesol which indicates the condensation of 2-methyl-GPP and IPP to 6-methyl-FPP by the E. coli FPP-synthase. Our study demonstrates the broad range of unusual terpenes accessible by expression of GPP-methyltransferases and C11-terpene synthases in E. coli and provides an extended mechanism for C11-terpene synthases.">

In this study, bioinformatics, metabolomics, and biochemical and molecular methodologies were integrated to investigate the candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile components in two cultivars of Freesia x hybrida, Red RiverÂ® and Ambiance, which release different categories of compounds. We found that terpene synthase (TPS) genes were the pivotal genes determining spatiotemporal release of volatile compounds in both cultivars. Eight FhTPS genes were isolated and six were found to be functional: FhTPS1 was a single-product enzyme catalyzing the formation of linalool, whereas the other four FhTPS proteins were multi-product enzymes, among which FhTPS4, FhTPS6, and FhTPS7 could recognize geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate simultaneously. The FhTPS enzymatic products closely matched the volatile terpenes emitted from flowers, and significant correlations were found between release of volatile terpenes and FhTPS gene expression. Graphical models based on these results are proposed that summarize the biosynthesis of Freesia floral volatile terpenes. The characterization of FhTPS genes paves the way to decipher their roles in the speciation and fitness of Freesia, and this knowledge could also be used to introduce or enhance scent in other plants.">

The full-length sequences of the &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;STPS1 and &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;STPS2 genes were expressed in the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; pQE-2 expression vector. The sizes of &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;STPS1 and &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;STPS2 were 1098 bp and 1967 bp, respectively, with open reading frames (ORF) of 1047 and 1695 bp and encoding polypeptides of 348 and 564 amino acids, respectively. The proteins consist of three conserved motifs, namely, Asp-rich substrate binding (DDxxD), metal binding residues (NSE/DTE), and cytoplasmic ER retention (RxR), as well as the terpene synthase family N-terminal domain and C-terminal metal-binding domain. From the in vitro enzyme assays, using the farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate, the &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;STPS1 enzyme produced multiple acyclic sesquiterpenes of Î²-farnesene, Î±-farnesene, and farnesol, while the &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;STPS2 enzyme produced an additional nerolidol as a final product. The results confirmed the roles of &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;STPS1 and &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;STPS2 in the biosynthesis pathway of &lt;i&gt;P. minus&lt;/i&gt;, to produce aromatic sesquiterpenes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Polianthes tuberosa is a popular ornamental plant. Its floral scent volatiles mainly consist of terpenes and benzenoids that emit a charming fragrance. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for the floral scent of P. tuberosa is limited. Using transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly, a total of 228,706,703 high-quality reads were obtained, which resulted in the identification of 96,906 unigenes (SRA Accession Number SRP126470, TSA Acc. No. GGEA00000000). Approximately 41.85% of the unigenes were functionally annotated using public databases. A total of 4,694 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)were discovered during flowering. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the majority of the volatiles comprised benzenoids and small amounts of terpenes. Homology analysis identified 13 and 17 candidate genes associated with terpene and benzenoid biosynthesis, respectively. Among these, PtTPS1, PtDAHPSs, PtPAL1, and PtBCMT2 might play important roles in regulating the formation of floral volatiles. The data generated by transcriptome sequencing provide a critical resource for exploring concrete characteristics as well as for supporting functional genomics studies. The results of the present study also lay the foundation for the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of floral scents in monocots.">

        <span class="abst" title="Rice blast disease, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is the most devastating disease of rice. In our ongoing characterization of the defence mechanisms of rice plants against M.Â oryzae, a terpene synthase gene OsTPS19 was identified as a candidate defence gene. Here, we report the functional characterization of OsTPS19, which is up-regulated by M.Â oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsTPS19 in rice plants enhanced resistance against M.Â oryzae, while OsTPS19 RNAi lines were more susceptible to the pathogen. Metabolic analysis revealed that the production of a monoterpene (S)-limonene was increased and decreased in OsTPS19 overexpression and RNAi lines, respectively, suggesting that OsTPS19 functions as a limonene synthase in planta. This notion was further supported by inÂ vitro enzyme assays with recombinant OsTPS19, in which OsTPS19 had both sesquiterpene activity and monoterpene synthase activity, with limonene as a major product. Furthermore, in a subcellular localization experiment, OsTPS19 was localized in plastids. OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event. We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity. The expression of OsTPS20 was not affected by M.Â oryzae infection. This indicates functional divergence of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20. Lastly, (S)-limonene inhibited the germination of M.Â oryzae spores inÂ vitro. OsTPS19 was determined to function as an (S)-limonene synthase in rice and plays a role in defence against M.Â oryzae, at least partly, by inhibiting spore germination.">

        <span class="abst" title="Insects use a diverse array of specialized terpene metabolites as pheromones in intraspecific interactions. In contrast to plants and microbes, which employ enzymes called terpene synthases (TPSs) to synthesize terpene metabolites, limited information from few species is available about the enzymatic mechanisms underlying terpene pheromone biosynthesis in insects. Several stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), among them severe agricultural pests, release 15-carbon sesquiterpenes with a bisabolene skeleton as sex or aggregation pheromones. The harlequin bug, &lt;i&gt;Murgantia histrionica&lt;/i&gt;, a specialist pest of crucifers, uses two stereoisomers of 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol as a male-released aggregation pheromone called murgantiol. We show that &lt;i&gt;Mh&lt;/i&gt;TPS (&lt;i&gt;Mh&lt;/i&gt;IDS-1), an enzyme unrelated to plant and microbial TPSs but with similarity to &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDS) of the core terpene biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the formation of (1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,6&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,7&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-1,10-bisaboladien-1-ol (sesquipiperitol) as a terpene intermediate in murgantiol biosynthesis. Sesquipiperitol, a so-far-unknown compound in animals, also occurs in plants, indicating convergent evolution in the biosynthesis of this sesquiterpene. RNAi-mediated knockdown of &lt;i&gt;MhTPS&lt;/i&gt; mRNA confirmed the role of &lt;i&gt;MhTPS&lt;/i&gt; in murgantiol biosynthesis. &lt;i&gt;Mh&lt;/i&gt;TPS expression is highly specific to tissues lining the cuticle of the abdominal sternites of mature males. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that &lt;i&gt;Mh&lt;/i&gt;TPS is derived from a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-IDS progenitor and diverged from bona fide &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-IDS proteins including &lt;i&gt;Mh&lt;/i&gt;IDS-2, which functions as an (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase. Structure-guided mutagenesis revealed several residues critical to &lt;i&gt;Mh&lt;/i&gt;TPS and &lt;i&gt;Mh&lt;/i&gt;FPPS activity. The emergence of an IDS-like protein with TPS activity in &lt;i&gt;M. histrionica&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates that de novo terpene biosynthesis evolved in the Hemiptera in an adaptation for intraspecific communication.">

        <span class="abst" title="Dictyostelids, or social amoebae, have a unique life style in forming multicellular fruiting bodies from unicellular amoeboids upon starvation. Recently, dictyostelids were found to contain terpene synthase (TPS) genes, a gene type of secondary metabolism previously known to occur only in plants, fungi and bacteria. Here we report an evolutionary functional study of dictyostelid TPS genes. The number of TPS genes in six species of dictyostelids examined ranges from 1 to 19; and the model species Dictyostelium purpureum contains 12 genes. Using in vitro enzyme assays, the 12 TPS genes from D. purpureum were shown to encode functional enzymes with distinct product profiles. The expression of the 12 TPS genes in D. purpureum is developmentally regulated. During multicellular development, D. purpureum releases a mixture of volatile terpenes dominated by sesquiterpenes that are the in vitro products of a subset of the 12 TPS genes. The quality and quantity of the terpenes released from D. purpureum, however, bear little resemblance to those of D. discoideum, a closely related dictyostelid. Despite these variations, the conserved clade of dictyostelid TPSs, which have an evolutionary distance of more than 600 million years, has the same biochemical function, catalyzing the formation of a sesquiterpene protoillud-7-ene. Taken together, our results indicate that the dynamic evolution of dictyostelid TPS genes includes both purifying selection of an orthologous group and species-specific expansion with functional divergence. Consequently, the terpenes produced by these TPSs most likely have conserved as well as species-adaptive biological functions as chemical languages in dictyostelids.">

Genome mining of different fungal collections has revealed the genetic basis for a steadily increasing number of putative terpene synthases without any detailed knowledge about their biochemical properties. The analysis and research of this rich genetic source provides a precious basis for the advancing biotechnological production of an almost endless number of valuable natural metabolites.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Three annotated terpene synthases from the little investigated Basidiomycota Coniophora puteana were studied in this work. For biochemical characterization, the heterologous expression in E. coli was conducted leading to the identification of two sesquiterpene synthases capable of the highly selective generation of Î²-copaene and cubebol. These compounds are commercially used as food and flavor additives. The new enzymes show the highest reported product selectivity for their main compounds and therefore represent the first exclusive synthases for Î²-copaene (62% product selectivity) and cubebol (75% product selectivity) generation. In combination with an optimized heterologous microbial production system, we obtained product titers of 215Â mg/L Î²-copaene and 497Â mg/L cubebol.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The reported product selectivity and our generated terpene titers exceed all published biotechnological data regarding the production of Î²-copaene and cubebol. This represents a promising and economic alternative to extraction from natural plant sources and the associated complex product purification.">

The medicinal effects of its bioactive compounds such as hypsin and hypsiziprenol have been reported, but the genetic basis or biosynthesis of these components is unknown.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, we sequenced a reference strain of H. marmoreus (Haemi 51,987-8). We evaluated various assembly strategies, and as a result the Allpaths and PBJelly produced the best assembly. The resulting genome was 42.7 Mbp in length and annotated with 16,627 gene models. A putative gene (Hypma_04324) encoding the antifungal and antiproliferative hypsin protein with 75% sequence identity with the previously known N-terminal sequence was identified. Carbohydrate active enzyme analysis displayed the typical feature of white-rot fungi where auxiliary activity and carbohydrate-binding modules were enriched. The genome annotation revealed four terpene synthase genes responsible for terpenoid biosynthesis. From the gene tree analysis, we identified that terpene synthase genes can be classified into six clades. Four terpene synthase genes of H. marmoreus belonged to four different groups that implies they may be involved in the synthesis of different structures of terpenes. A terpene synthase gene cluster was well-conserved in Agaricomycetes genomes, which contained known biosynthesis and regulatory genes.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Genome sequence analysis of this mushroom led to the discovery of the hypsin gene. Comparative genome analysis revealed the conserved gene cluster for terpenoid biosynthesis in the genome. These discoveries will further our understanding of the biosynthesis of medicinal bioactive molecules in this edible mushroom.">

The aroma, flavor and pharmaceutical value of Ocimum species is a significance of its essential oil, which contains most of the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. A large number of plants have been studied for characterization and identification of terpene synthase genes, involved in terpenoids biosynthesis. The goal of this study is to discover and identify the putative functional terpene synthase genes in O. sanctum. HMMER search was performed by using a set of 13 well sequenced and annotated plant genomes including the newly sequenced genome of O. sanctum with Pfam-A database locally, using HMMER 3.0 hmmsearch for the two Pfam domains (PF01397 and PF03936). Using this search method 81 putative terpene synthases genes (OsaTPS) were identified in O. sanctum; the study further reveals 47 OsaTPS were putatively functional genes, 19 partial OsaTPS, and 15 OsaTPS as probably pseudogenes. All these identified OsaTPS genes were compared with other plant species, and phylogenetic analysis reveals the subfamily classification of OsaTPS in TPS-a, -b, -c, -e, -f and TPS-g subfamilies clusters. This genome-wide identification of OsaTPS genes, their phylogenetic analysis and secondary metabolite pathway mapping predictions together provide a comprehensive understanding of the TPS gene family in Ocimum sanctum and offer opportunities for the characterization and functional validation of numbers of terpene synthase genes.">

Aromas produced by scented species are remarkably diverse such as rose, mint, lemon, nutmeg, ginger and many others scents. Amongst odorant species, rose-scented pelargoniums, also named pelargonium rosat, are the most famous hybrids for their production of essential oil (EO), widely used by perfume and cosmetic industries. Although EO composition has been extensively studied, the underlying biosynthetic pathways and their regulation, most notably of terpenes, are largely unknown. To gain a better understanding of the terpene metabolic pathways in pelargonium rosat, we generated a transcriptome dataset of pelargonium leaf and used a candidate gene approach to functionally characterise four terpene synthases (TPSs), including a geraniol synthase, a key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the main rose-scented terpenes. We also report for the first time the characterisation of a novel sesquiterpene synthase catalysing the biosynthesis of 10-epi-Î³-eudesmol. We found a strong correlation between expression of the four genes encoding the respective TPSs and accumulation of the corresponding products in several pelargonium cultivars and species. Finally, using publically available RNA-Seq data and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome assemblies, we inferred a maximum likelihood phylogeny from 270 pelargonium TPSs, including the four newly discovered enzymes, providing clues about TPS evolution in the &lt;i&gt;Pelargonium&lt;/i&gt; genus. Notably, we show that, by contrast to other TPSs, geraniol synthases from the TPS-g subfamily conserved their molecular function throughout evolution.">

In forest trees, many classes of compounds, particularly ones related to defense against insects, fungi, and bacteria accumulate to levels that enable their recovery and commercial use. One of the oldest examples is conifer terpenes, but terpenes are important secondary products from other tree species including eucalypts. Because terpenes, latex, and natural gums are synthesized and stored in specialized secretory glands, ducts, and laticifers in mostly pure forms they can be collected from live trees in addition to being extracted during industrial processing of wood. This minireview describes the potential of breeding and genetic engineering approaches to increase the quantities of terpene secondary metabolites to increase the amount of secondary products and thereby increasing the value of planted and managed forest trees. I advance the view that breeding and genetic engineering of metabolic pathways and specialized cell secretory structures can dramatically increase tissue terpene content.">

A transcriptome approach was used to determine the unique terpene biosynthesis pathway and to explore the different regulatory mechanisms responsible for the variation of terpene content among individuals. Analysis of &lt;i&gt;de novo-&lt;/i&gt;assembled contigs revealed a complete set of genes for terpene biosynthesis. A total of 23,261 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) were discovered between high and low oil-yielding plants. DEG enrichment analysis suggested that the terpene biosynthesis process and the plant hormone signal transduction pathway may exert a major role in determining terpene variation in &lt;i&gt;S. glabra&lt;/i&gt;. The expression patterns of candidate genes were further verified by quantitative RT-PCR experiments. Key genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis pathway were predominantly expressed in phloem and root tissues. Phylogenetic analysis and subcellular localization implied that &lt;i&gt;S. glabra&lt;/i&gt; terpene synthases may evolve from a common ancestor. Furthermore, two sesquiterpene synthase genes, &lt;i&gt;SgSTPS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SgSTPS2&lt;/i&gt;, were functionally characterized. SgSTPS1 mainly generated Î²-caryophyllene from farnesyl pyrophosphate. SgSTPS2 is a versatile enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 12 sequiterpenes from farnesyl pyrophosphate and synthesis of three monoterpenes using geranyl pyrophosphate. Together, these results provide large reservoir for elucidating the molecular mechanism of terpene biosynthesis and for exploring the ecological function of sesquiterpenes in &lt;i&gt;S. glabra&lt;/i&gt;.">

Economic viability for commercial applications is commonly not achievable by using natural source organisms or chemical synthesis. Engineered bio-production in suitable heterologous hosts is often required to achieve commercial viability. However, our poor understanding of regulatory mechanisms and other biochemical processes makes obtaining efficient conversion yields from feedstocks challenging. Moreover, production from carbon dioxide via photosynthesis would significantly increase the environmental and potentially the economic credentials of these processes by disintermediating biomass feedstocks. In this paper, we briefly review terpenoid metabolism, outline some recent advances in terpenoid metabolic engineering, and discuss why photosynthetic unicellular organisms-such as algae and cyanobacteria-might be preferred production platforms for the expression of some of the more challenging terpenoid pathways.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Scutellaria barbata&lt;/i&gt; (Lamiaceae) is an important medicinal herb widely used in China, Korea, India, and other Asian countries. &lt;i&gt;Neo&lt;/i&gt;-clerodane diterpenoids are the largest known group of &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria&lt;/i&gt; diterpenoids and show promising cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines. Here, Illumina-based deep transcriptome analysis of flowers, the aerial parts (leaf and stem), and roots of &lt;i&gt;S. barbata&lt;/i&gt; was used to explore terpenoid-related genes. In total, 121,958,564 clean RNA-sequence reads were assembled into 88,980 transcripts, with an average length of 1370 nt and N50 length of 2144 nt, indicating high assembly quality. We identified nearly all known terpenoid-related genes (33 genes) involved in biosynthesis of the terpenoid backbone and 14 terpene synthase genes which generate skeletons for different terpenoids. Three full length diterpene synthase genes were functionally identified using an in vitro assay. &lt;i&gt;Sb&lt;/i&gt;TPS8 and &lt;i&gt;Sb&lt;/i&gt;TPS9 were identified as normal-CPP and &lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-CPP synthase, respectively. &lt;i&gt;Sb&lt;/i&gt;TPS12 reacts with &lt;i&gt;Sb&lt;/i&gt;TPS8 to produce miltiradiene. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Sb&lt;/i&gt;TPS12 was proven to be a less promiscuous class I diterpene synthase. These results give a comprehensive understanding of the terpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;S. barbata&lt;/i&gt; and provide useful information for enhancing the production of bioactive &lt;i&gt;neo&lt;/i&gt;-clerodane diterpenoids through genetic engineering.">

        <span class="abst" title="Root herbivory caused by larvae of the forest cockchafer (Melolontha hippocastani) enhances the impact of drought on trees, particularly in oak forest rejuvenations. In Germany, geographically distant oak stands show differences in infestation strength by the forest cockchafer. While in Southwestern Germany this insect causes severe damage, oak forests in northern Germany are rarely infested. It is known that root-released volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are perceived by soil herbivores, thus guiding the larvae toward the host roots. In this work, we exposed seedlings of two distant oak provenances to forest cockchafer larvae and studied their population genetic properties, their root-based VOC chemotypes, their attraction for larvae and terpene synthase gene expression. Based on nuclear and chloroplast marker analysis, we found both oak populations to be genetically highly variable while showing typical patterns of migration from different refugial regions. However, no clear association between genetic constitution of the different provenances and the abundance of cockchafer populations on site was observed. In contrast to observations in the field, bioassays revealed a preference of the larvae for the northeastern oak provenance. The behavior of larvae was most likely related to root-released volatile terpenes and benzenoids since their composition and quantity differed between oak populations. We assume repellent effects of these compounds because the populations attractive to insects showed low abundance of these compounds. Five different oak terpene synthase (TPS) genes were identified at the genomic level which can be responsible for biosynthesis of the released terpenes. TPS gene expression patterns in response to larval feeding revealed geographic variation rather than genotypic variation. Our results support the assumption that root-released VOC are influencing the perception of roots by herbivores.">

However, the molecular genetic basis of terpene biosynthesis pathways is virtually unknown. In this study, approximately 4â€‰Gb of raw data were generated from the transcriptome of S. guaranitica leaves using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing. After filtering and removing the adapter sequences from the raw data, the number of reads reached 32 million, comprising 186 million of high-quality nucleotide bases. A total of 61,400 unigenes were assembled de novo and annotated for establishing a valid database for studying terpenoid biosynthesis. We identified 267 unigenes that are putatively involved in terpenoid metabolism (including, 198 mevalonate and methyl-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes and 69 terpene synthases genes). Moreover, three terpene synthase genes were studied for their functions in terpenoid biosynthesis by using transgenic Arabidopsis; most transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing these terpene synthetic genes produced increased amounts of terpenoids compared with wild-type control. The combined data analyses from the transcriptome and metabolome provide new insights into our understanding of the complex metabolic genes in terpenoid-rich blue anise sage, and our study paves the way for the future metabolic engineering of the biosynthesis of useful terpene compounds in S. guaranitica.">

While the formation of volatiles above-ground has been intensively studied, little is known about herbivore-induced root volatiles. Here, we show that cockchafer larvae-damaged roots of Populus trichocarpa and P. nigra release a mixture of monoterpenes, including (-)-Î±-pinene, (-)-camphene, (-)-Î²-pinene, p-cymene, and 1,8-cineole. Three terpene synthases, PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 from P. trichocarpa and PnTPS4 from P. nigra, could be identified and characterized in vitro. PnTPS4 was found to produce 1,8-cineole as sole product. PtTPS16 and PtTPS21, although highly similar to each other, showed different product specificities and produced Î³-terpinene and a mixture of (-)-camphene, (-)-Î±-pinene, (-)-Î²-pinene, and (-)-limonene, respectively. Four active site residues were found to determine the different product specificities of the two enzymes. The expression profiles of PtTPS16, PtTPS21, and PnTPS4 in undamaged and herbivore-damaged poplar roots generally matched the emission pattern of monoterpenes, indicating that monoterpene emission in roots is mainly determined at the gene transcript level. Bioassays with Phytophtora cactorum (Oomycetes) revealed inhibitory effects of vapor-phase 1,8-cineole and (-)-Î²-pinene on the growth of this important plant pathogen. Thus herbivore-induced volatile monoterpenes may have a role in defense against pathogens that cause secondary infections after root wounding.">

High demand coupled with deforestation have caused a decrease in natural teak forests, and future supplies will be reliant on teak plantations. Hence, selection of teak tree varieties for clonal propagation with superior growth performance is of great importance, and access to high-quality genetic and genomic resources can accelerate the selection process by identifying genes underlying desired traits.&lt;h4&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;To facilitate teak research and variety improvement, we generated a highly contiguous, chromosomal-scale genome assembly using high-coverage Pacific Biosciences long reads coupled with high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. Of the 18 teak chromosomes, we generated 17 near-complete pseudomolecules with one chromosome present as two chromosome arm scaffolds. Genome annotation yielded 31,168 genes encoding 46,826 gene models, of which, 39,930 and 41,155 had Pfam domain and expression evidence, respectively. We identified 14 clusters of tandem-duplicated terpene synthases (TPSs), genes central to the biosynthesis of terpenes, which are involved in plant defense and pollinator attraction. Transcriptome analysis revealed 10 TPSs highly expressed in woody tissues, of which, 8 were in tandem, revealing the importance of resolving tandemly duplicated genes and the quality of the assembly and annotation. We also validated the enzymatic activity of four TPSs to demonstrate the function of key TPSs.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;In summary, this high-quality chromosomal-scale assembly and functional annotation of the teak genome will facilitate the discovery of candidate genes related to traits critical for sustainable production of teak and for anti-insecticidal natural products.">

        <span class="abst" title="Most plant viruses are vectored by insects and the interactions of virus-plant-vector have important ecological and evolutionary implications. Insect vectors often perform better on virus-infected plants. This indirect mutualism between plant viruses and insect vectors promotes the spread of virus and has significant agronomical effects. However, few studies have investigated how plant viruses manipulate plant defenses and promote vector performance. Begomoviruses are a prominent group of plant viruses in tropical and sub-tropical agro-ecosystems and are transmitted by whiteflies. Working with the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, begomoviruses and tobacco, we revealed that C2 protein of begomoviruses lacking DNA satellites was responsible for the suppression of plant defenses against whitefly vectors. We found that infection of plants by tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), one of the most devastating begomoviruses worldwide, promoted the survival and reproduction of whitefly vectors. TYLCV C2 protein suppressed plant defenses by interacting with plant ubiquitin. This interaction compromised the degradation of JAZ1 protein, thus inhibiting jasmonic acid defense and the expression of MYC2-regulated terpene synthase genes. We further demonstrated that function of C2 protein among begomoviruses not associated with satellites is well conserved and ubiquitination is an evolutionarily conserved target of begomoviruses for the suppression of plant resistance to whitefly vectors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ubiquitination inhibition by begomovirus C2 protein might be a general mechanism in begomovirus, whitefly and plant interactions.">

Particularly, terpenoid and phenylpropanoid metabolites, major components of the root-derived oleo-gum-resin, exhibit anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities, thus offering a resource for potential therapeutic lead compounds. However, genes and enzymes for terpenoid and coumarin-type phenylpropanoid metabolism have thus far remained uncharacterized in F. assafoetida Comparative de novo transcriptome analysis of roots, leaves, stems, and flowers was combined with computational annotation to identify candidate genes with probable roles in terpenoid and coumarin biosynthesis. Gene network analysis showed a high abundance of predicted terpenoid- and phenylpropanoid-metabolic pathway genes in flowers. These findings offer a deeper insight into natural product biosynthesis in F. assafoetida and provide genomic resources for exploiting the medicinal potential of this rare plant.">

Cannabis is a controlled substance and until recently was illegal in many jurisdictions. Consequently, the study of this plant has been restricted. Proteomics studies on &lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; reported so far have been primarily based on plant organs and tissues other than buds, such as roots, hypocotyl, leaves, hempseeds and flour. As far as we know, no optimisation of protein extraction from cannabis reproductive tissues has been attempted. Therefore, we set out to assess different protein extraction methods followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics to recover, separate and identify the proteins of the reproductive organs of medicinal cannabis, apical buds and isolated trichomes. Database search following shotgun proteomics was limited to protein sequences from &lt;i&gt;C. sativa&lt;/i&gt; and closely related species available from UniprotKB. Our results demonstrate that a buffer containing the chaotrope reagent guanidine hydrochloride recovers many more proteins than a urea-based buffer. In combination with a precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, such buffer proved optimum to identify proteins using a trypsin digestion followed by nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) analyses. This is validated by focusing on enzymes involved in the phytocannabinoid pathway.">

        <span class="abst" title="The curry tree (Bergera koenigii L.) is a widely cultivated plant used in South Asian cooking. Next-generation sequencing was used to generate the transcriptome of the curry leaf to detect changes in gene expression during leaf development, such as those genes involved in the production of oils which lend the leaf its characteristic taste, aroma, and medicinal properties. Using abundance estimation (RSEM) and differential expression analysis, genes that were significantly differentially expressed were identified. The transcriptome was annotated with BLASTx using the non-redundant (nr) protein database, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms were assigned based on the top BLAST hit using Blast2GO. Lastly, functional enrichment of the assigned GO terms was analyzed for genes that were significantly differentially expressed. Of the most enriched GO categories, pathways involved in cell wall, membrane, and lignin synthesis were found to be most upregulated in immature leaf tissue, possibly due to the growth and expansion of the leaf tissue. Terpene synthases, which synthesize monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which comprise much of the curry essential oil, were found to be significantly upregulated in mature leaf tissue, suggesting that oil production increases later in leaf development. Enzymes involved in pigment production were also significantly upregulated in mature leaves. The findings were based on computational estimates of gene expression from RNA-seq data, and further study is warranted to validate these results using targeted techniques, such as quantitative PCR.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Valencene is a major sesquiterpene in citrus oil and biosynthesized by valencene synthase (Cstps1; EC: 4.2.3.73) from the 15-carbon substrate farnesyl diphosphate. It is abundant in juice of some mandarins (e.g. Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. Fortune), however, it is undetectable in others (e.g. C. reticulata Blanco cv. Murcott), We have discovered that the Murcott mandarin Cstps1 gene expression is severely reduced. A previous genetic mapping study using an F1 population of Fortune Ã— Murcott found that the segregation of valencene production in fruit exhibited a Mendelian inheritance ratio of 1:1. There was only one dominant locus associated with valencene content detected on the mandarin genetic map. The goal of this study was to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the valencene deficiency observed in some citrus hybrids.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;There was a clear relationship between presence or absence of the valencene synthase gene (Cstps1) expression, and presence or absence of valencene among randomly selected mandarin hybrids. Cloning the coding regions of Cstps1 from Fortune and Murcott mandarin, and aligning with previous reported Valencia orange Cstps1 sequence, showed that they both exhibited extremely high similarity with the known Cstps1. By further cloning and analyzing the promoter region of Cstps1 from Valencia, Fortune and Murcott, a 12-nucleotide deletion at approximately -â€‰270â€‰bp from the Cstps1 coding region was only found in Murcott. Three binary vectors, designated as p1380-FortP-GUSin, p1380-MurcP-GUSin and p1380-MurcP(+â€‰12)-GUSin, were developed for promoter activity analysis. Transient over-expression of Fortune Cstps1 promoter in sweet orange showed notable GUS activity, but the Murcott Cstps1 promoter did not. In addition, by re-inserting the 12-nucleotide fragment, the activity of the Murcott Cstps1 promoter was mostly recovered.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The deficiency of valencene production in some mandarins is probably due to a 12-nucleotide deletion in the promoter region of the Cstps1, which could be a crucial switch of Cstps1 transcription. Our results further enhanced the understanding of valencene biosynthesis in citrus.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Due to their high energy density and compatible physical properties, several monoterpenes have been investigated as potential renewable transportation fuels, either as blendstocks with petroleum or as drop-in replacements for use in vehicles (both heavy and light-weight) or in aviation. Sustainable microbial production of these biofuels requires the ability to utilize cheap and readily available feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass, which can be depolymerized into fermentable carbon sources such as glucose and xylose. However, common microbial production platforms such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not naturally capable of utilizing xylose, hence requiring extensive strain engineering and optimization to efficiently utilize lignocellulosic feedstocks. In contrast, the oleaginous red yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is capable of efficiently metabolizing both xylose and glucose, suggesting that it may be a suitable host for the production of lignocellulosic bioproducts. In addition, R. toruloides naturally produces several carotenoids (C40 terpenoids), indicating that it may have a naturally high carbon flux through its mevalonate (MVA) pathway, providing pools of intermediates for the production of a wide range of heterologous terpene-based biofuels and bioproducts from lignocellulose.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Sixteen terpene synthases (TS) originating from plants, bacteria and fungi were evaluated for their ability to produce a total of nine different monoterpenes in R. toruloides. Eight of these TS were functional and produced several different monoterpenes, either as individual compounds or as mixtures, with 1,8-cineole, sabinene, ocimene, pinene, limonene, and carene being produced at the highest levels. The 1,8-cineole synthase HYP3 from Hypoxylon sp. E74060B produced the highest titer of 14.94â€‰Â±â€‰1.84Â mg/L 1,8-cineole in YPD medium and was selected for further optimization and fuel properties study. Production of 1,8-cineole from lignocellulose was also demonstrated in a 2L batch fermentation, and cineole production titers reached 34.6Â mg/L in DMR-EH (Deacetylated, Mechanically Refined, Enzymatically Hydorlized) hydrolysate. Finally, the fuel properties of 1,8-cineole were examined, and indicate that it may be a suitable petroleum blend stock or drop-in replacement fuel for spark ignition engines.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our results demonstrate that Rhodosporidium toruloides is a suitable microbial platform for the production of non-native monoterpenes with biofuel applications from lignocellulosic biomass.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;It is well known that aromatic essential oils extracted from the heartwood of Santalum album L. have wide economic value. However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of Î±-santalene, epi-Î²-santalene, Î²-santalene, Î±-santalol, Î²-santalol, (E)-Î±-bergamotene, (E)-Î²-farnesene and Î²-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly Î±-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-Î±-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-Î²-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products. Metabolite signatures and gene expression studies confirmed that santalol content is closely related with santalene synthase (SaSSY) transcripts in heartwood, which is key enzyme responsible for santalol biosynthesis. However, the expression of three new SaTPS genes differed significantly from SaSSY in the essential oil-producing heartwood. Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4Â°C, 38Â°C and high light intensity. MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of SaTPS1 and SaTPS2 in leaves. SaTPS1 to 3 transcripts were differentially activated among different tissues under adverse temperature and light stresses. In contrast, almost all SaSSY transcripts decreased in response to these environmental stresses, unlike SaTPS1 to 3.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Multifunctional enzymes were biochemically characterized, including one chloroplastic mono-TPS and two cytosolic sesqui-TPSs in sandalwood. Our results suggest the ecological importance of these three new SaTPS genes in defensive response to biotic attack and abiotic stresses in S. album.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Panax ginseng C. A. Mey is one of famous medicinal herb plant species. Its major bioactive compounds are various ginsenosides in roots and rhizomes. It is commonly accepted that ginsenosides are synthesized from terpene precursors, IPP and DMAPP, through the cytoplasmic mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Another plastic 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway was proved also contributing to ginsenoside generation in the roots of P. ginseng by using specific chemical inhibitors recently. But their gene expression characteristics are still under reveal in P. ginseng. With the development of the high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, we have opportunities to discover more about the complex ginsenoside biosynthesis pathways in P. ginseng.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We carried out deep RNA sequencing and comprehensive analyses on the ginseng root samples of 1-5â€‰years old and five different tissues of 5â€‰years old ginseng plants. The de novo assembly totally generated 48,165 unigenes, including 380 genes related to ginsenoside biosynthesis and all the genes encoding the enzymes of the MEP pathway and the MVA pathway. We further illustrated the gene expression profiles related to ginsenoside biosynthesis among 1-5â€‰year-old roots and different tissues of 5â€‰year-old ginseng plants. Particularly for the first time, we revealed that the gene transcript abundances of the MEP pathway were similar to those of the MVA pathway in ginseng roots but higher in ginseng leaves. The IspD was predicated to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the MEP pathway through both co-expression network and gene expression profile analyses.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;At the transcriptional level, the MEP pathway has similar contribution to ginsenoside biosynthesis in ginseng roots, but much higher in ginseng leaves, compared with the MVA pathway. The IspD might be the key enzyme for ginsenoside generation through the MEP pathway. These results provide new information for further synthetic biology study on ginsenoside metabolic regulation.">

DdTPS8 catalyzes the formation of a sesquiterpene discoidol, which is undetectable from the volatile bouquet of wild type &lt;i&gt;D. discoideum&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, a &lt;i&gt;DdTPS8&lt;/i&gt; knockout mutant lacks not only discoidol, but also a putative trisnorsesquiterpene. This compound was hypothesized to be derived from discoidol via cytochrome P450 (CYP)-catalyzed oxidative cleavage. &lt;i&gt;CYP521A1&lt;/i&gt;, which is clustered with &lt;i&gt;DdTPS8&lt;/i&gt;, was identified as a top candidate. Biochemical assays demonstrated that CYP521A1 catalyzes the conversion of discoidol to a novel trisnorsesquiterpene named discodiene. The &lt;i&gt;DdTPS8&lt;/i&gt; knockout mutant exhibited slow progression in development. This study points to the untapped diversity of natural products made by &lt;i&gt;D. discoideum&lt;/i&gt;, which may have diverse roles in its development and chemical ecology.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Farnesol is an acyclic sesquiterpene alcohol present in the essential oils of various plants in nature. It has been reported to be valuable in medical applications, such as alleviation of allergic asthma, gliosis, and edema as well as anti-cancerous and anti-inflammatory effects. Coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), an essential cofactor in the aerobic respiratory electron transport chain, has attracted growing interest owing to its clinical benefits and important applications in the pharmaceutical, food, and health industries. In this work, co-production of (E,E)-farnesol (FOH) and CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; was achieved by combining 3 different exogenous terpenes or sesquiterpene synthase with the RNA interference of psy (responsible for phytoene synthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides GY-2).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;FOH production was significantly increased by overexpressing exogenous terpene synthase (TPS), phosphatidylglycerophosphatase B (PgpB), and sesquiterpene synthase (ATPS), as well as RNAi-mediated silencing of psy coding phytoene synthase (PSY) in R. sphaeroides strains. Rs-TPS, Rs-ATPS, and Rs-PgpB respectively produced 68.2%, 43.4%, and 21.9% higher FOH titers than that of the control strain. Interestingly, the CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; production of these 3 recombinant R. sphaeroides strains was exactly opposite to that of FOH. However, CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; production was almost unaffected in R. sphaeroides strains modified by psy RNA interference. The highest FOH production of 40.45Â mg/L, which was twice as high as that of the control, was obtained from the TPS-PSYi strain, where the exogenous TPS was combined with the weakening of the phytoene synthesis pathway via psy RNA interference. CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; production in TPS-PSYi, ATPS-PSYi, and PgpB-PSYi was decreased and lower than that of the control strain.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The original flux that contributed to phytoene synthesis was effectively redirected to provide precursors toward FOH or CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis via psy RNA interference, which led to weakened carotenoid synthesis. The improved flux that was originally involved in CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; production and phytoene synthesis was redirected toward FOH synthesis via metabolic modification. This is the first reported instance of FOH and CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; co-production in R. sphaeroides using a metabolic engineering strategy.">

However, a global understanding of gene or protein expression regulation in primary and secondary metabolism and related regulatory processes is still lacking. In this study, we employed transcriptomics and proteomics of &lt;i&gt;Gilmaniella&lt;/i&gt; sp. AL12-inoculated and &lt;i&gt;Gilmaniella&lt;/i&gt; sp. AL12-free plants to study the impact of endophyte inoculation at the transcriptional and translational levels. The results showed that plant genes involved in plant immunity and signaling were suppressed, similar to the plant response caused by some endophytic fungi and biotroph pathogen. The downregulated plant immunity may contribute to plant-endophyte beneficial interaction. Additionally, genes and proteins related to primary metabolism (carbon fixation, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism) tended to be upregulated after &lt;i&gt;Gilmaniella&lt;/i&gt; sp. AL12 inoculation, which was consistent with our previous physiological evidences. And, &lt;i&gt;Gilmaniella&lt;/i&gt; sp. AL12 upregulated genes involved in terpene skeleton biosynthesis, and upregulated genes annotated as Î²-farnesene synthase and Î²-caryophyllene synthase. Based on the above results, we proposed that endophyte-plant associations may improve production (biomass and sesquiterpenoids accumulation) by increasing the source (photosynthesis), expanding the sink (glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle), and enhancing the metabolic flux (sesquiterpenoids biosynthesis pathway) in &lt;i&gt;A. lancea&lt;/i&gt;. And, this study will help to further clarify plant-endophyte interactions.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene alcohol, is found as a primary constituent in the essential oils of plants such as geranium, lemongrass and rose. The floral-like scent of geraniol has made it a popular constituent of flavour and fragrance products. Over recent decades biotechnology has made significant progress towards the development of industrial platforms for the production of commercially valuable monoterpenoids, such as geraniol, through expression of recombinant terpene biosynthetic pathways in microbial hosts. Titres, however, have been hindered due to the inherent toxicity of these compounds-which are often utilised for anti-microbial and anti-fungal functions in their host plant.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study we modified an Escherichia coli strain, engineered to express a heterologous mevalonate pathway, by replacement of the terpene synthase with a geraniol synthase from Ocimum basilicum for the production of geraniol, and co-expressed an alcohol acyltransferase (AAT) from Rosa hybrida for the specific acetylation of geraniol. The low water solubility of geranyl acetate facilitated its partition into the organic phase of a two-phase system, relieving the cellular toxicity attributed to the build-up of geraniol in the aqueous phase. In a partially optimised system this strain produced 4.8Â g/L geranyl acetate (based on the aqueous volume) which, on a molar equivalent basis, represents the highest monoterpene titre achieved from microbial culture to date. It was also found that esterification of geraniol prevented bioconversion into other monoterpenoids, leading to a significant improvement in product specificity, with geranyl acetate being the sole product observed.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;In this study we have shown that it is possible to both overcome the toxicity limit impeding the production of the monoterpene alcohol geraniol and mitigate product loss in culture through endogenous metabolism by using an in vivo esterification strategy. This strategy has resulted in the highest geraniol (equivalent) titres achieved from a microbial host, and presents esterification as a viable approach to increasing the titres obtained in microbial monoterpenoid production.">

Transcript and terpene metabolite profiles were integrated to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon. In this research, three genotypes with different aromatic strengths were investigated by RNA sequencing. A total of 27 fruit samples from three biological replicates were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 at three stages, corresponding to the veraison; berries had intermediate Brix value and were harvest-ripe. After quality assessment and data clearance, a total of 254.18â€‰Gb of data with more than 97% Q20 bases were obtained, approximately 9.41â€‰Gb data were generated per sample.

        <span class="abst" title="Fungi are successful eukaryotes of wide distribution. They are known as rich producers of secondary metabolites, especially terpenoids, which are important for fungi-environment interactions. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important mechanism contributing to genetic innovation of fungi. However, it remains unclear whether HGT has played a role in creating the enormous chemical diversity of fungal terpenoids. Here we report that fungi have acquired terpene synthase genes (TPSs), which encode pivotal enzymes for terpenoid biosynthesis, from bacteria through HGT. Phylogenetic analysis placed the majority of fungal and bacterial TPS genes from diverse taxa into two clades, indicating ancient divergence. Nested in the bacterial TPS clade is a number of fungal TPS genes that are inferred as the outcome of HGT. These include a monophyletic clade of nine fungal TPS genes, designated as BTPSL for bacterial TPS-like genes, from eight species of related entomopathogenic fungi, including seven TPSs from six species in the genus Metarhizium. In vitro enzyme assays demonstrate that all seven BTPSL genes from the genus Metarhizium encode active enzymes with sesquiterpene synthase activities of two general product profiles. By analyzing the catalytic activity of two resurrected ancestral BTPSLs and one closely related bacterial TPS, the trajectory of functional evolution of BTPSLs after HGT from bacteria to fungi and functional divergence within Metarhizium could be traced. Using M. brunneum as a model species, both BTPSLs and typical fungal TPSs were demonstrated to be involved in the in vivo production of terpenoids, illustrating the general importance of HGT of TPS genes from bacteria as a mechanism contributing to terpenoid diversity in fungi.">

However, the presence of gossypol limits the utilization of cottonseed. Two pairs of cotton near isogenic lines (NILs) with different pigment glands, i.e., Coker 312 vs Coker 312â€‰W and CCRI12 vs CCRI12W, exhibit different gossypol contents. The glandless traits of Coker 312â€‰W and CCRI12W are controlled by recessive and dominant genes, respectively. However, knowledge regarding the genomic variations in the NILs is limited. Therefore, the NILs genomes were resequenced and the sequencing depths were greater than 34Ã—. Compared with the TM-1 genome, numerous SNPs, Indels, SVs, and CNVs were discovered. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that genes with SNPs and Indels from the recessive NILs and genes with Indels from the dominant NILs shared only one enriched pathway, i.e., the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is relevant to gossypol biosynthesis. Expression analysis revealed that key genes with variations that participate in the gossypol biosynthesis and pigment gland formation pathways had different expression patterns among the dominant, recessive glandless and glanded plants. The expression levels in the glanded organs were higher than those in their NILs. Altogether, our results provide deeper insight into cotton NILs with different pigment glands.">

We crossreferenced chemotaxonomic data with publicly available transcriptomes to select common selfheal (Prunella vulgaris) and its highly unusual vulgarisin diterpenoids as a case study for exploring the origins of diterpene skeletal diversity in Lamiaceae. Four terpene synthases (TPS) from the TPS-a subfamily, including two localised to the plastid, were cloned and functionally characterised. Previous examples of TPS-a enzymes from Lamiaceae were cytosolic and reported to act on the 15-carbon farnesyl diphosphate. Plastidial TPS-a enzymes using the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl diphosphate are known from other plant families, having apparently arisen independently in each family. All four new enzymes were found to be active on multiple prenyl-diphosphate substrates with different chain lengths and stereochemistries. One of the new enzymes catalysed the cyclisation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate into 11-hydroxy vulgarisane, the likely biosynthetic precursor of the vulgarisins. We uncovered the pathway to a rare diterpene skeleton. Our results support an emerging paradigm of substrate and compartment switching as important aspects of TPS evolution and diversification.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pandemics of vector-borne human and plant diseases often depend on the behaviors of their arthropod vectors. Arboviruses, including many bunyaviruses, manipulate vector behavior to accelerate their own transmission to vertebrates, birds, insects, and plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this manipulation remains elusive. Here, we report that the non-structural protein NSs of Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus, a prototype of the Tospoviridae family and the Orthotospovirus genus, is a key viral factor that indirectly modifies vector preference and increases vector performance. NSs suppresses the biosynthesis of plant volatile monoterpenes, which serve as repellents of the vector western flower thrips (WFT, Frankliniella occidentalis). NSs directly interacts with MYC2, the jasmonate (JA) signaling master regulator and its two close homologs MYC3 and MYC4, to disable JA-mediated activation of terpene synthase genes. The dysfunction of the MYCs subsequently attenuates host defenses, increases the attraction of thrips, and improves thrips fitness. Moreover, MYC2 associated with NSs of Tomato zonate spot orthotospovirus, another Euro/Asian-type orthotospovirus, suggesting that MYC2 is an evolutionarily conserved target of Orthotospovirus species for suppression of terpene-based resistance to promote vector performance. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which an orthotospovirus indirectly manipulates vector behaviors and therefore facilitates pathogen transmission. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which Orthotospovirus NSs counteracts plant immunity for pathogen transmission.">

However, little is known about the distribution and evolution of the genes for terpene synthases. Here, we performed whole-genome based phylogenetic analysis of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; species, and compared the distribution of terpene synthase genes among them. Overall, our study revealed that ten major types of terpene synthases are present within the genus &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt;, namely those for geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, &lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-isozizaene, 7-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-Î±-eudesmol, &lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-cubenol, caryolan-1-ol, cyclooctat-9-en-7-ol, isoafricanol, pentalenene and Î±-amorphene. The &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; species divide in three phylogenetic groups based on their whole genomes for which the distribution of the ten terpene synthases was analysed. Geosmin synthases were the most widely distributed and were found to be evolutionary positively selected. Other terpene synthases were found to be specific for one of the three clades or a subclade within the genus &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt;. A phylogenetic analysis of the most widely distributed classes of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; terpene synthases in comparison to the phylogenomic analysis of this genus is discussed.">

This review demonstrates how modern computational chemistry can be employed as an effective tool for revealing biosynthetic mechanisms and the potential of computational chemistry-for example, elucidating how enzymes regulate regio- and stereoselectivity, finding the key catalytic residue of an enzyme, and assessing the viability of hypothetical pathways.

The growing demand and issues in the supply have raised interest in the microbial production of the sesquiterpene khusimol, the main compound of the vetiver essential oil due to its woody smell. In this study, we engineered the biosynthetic pathway for the production of (+)-zizaene, the immediate precursor of khusimol. A systematic approach of metabolic engineering in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was applied to modulate the critical bottlenecks of the metabolic flux towards (+)-zizaene. Initially, production of (+)-zizaene was possible with the endogenous methylerythritol phosphate pathway and the codon-optimized zizaene synthase (ZS). Raising the precursor E,E-farnesyl diphosphate supply through the mevalonate pathway improved the (+)-zizaene titers 2.7-fold, although a limitation of the ZS supply was observed. To increase the ZS supply, distinct promoters were tested for the expression of the &lt;i&gt;ZS&lt;/i&gt; gene, which augmented 7.2-fold in the (+)-zizaene titers. Final metabolic enhancement for the ZS supply by using a multi-plasmid strain harboring multiple copies of the &lt;i&gt;ZS&lt;/i&gt; gene improved the (+)-zizaene titers 1.3-fold. The optimization of the fermentation conditions increased the (+)-zizaene titers 2.2-fold, achieving the highest (+)-zizaene titer of 25.09 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides an alternative strategy to enhance the terpene synthase supply for the engineering of isoprenoids. Moreover, it demonstrates the development of a novel microbial platform for the sustainable production of fragrant molecules for the cosmetic industry.">

Although some terpene synthases have been characterized, terpenoids and their biosynthesis in wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.) still remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the identification of a terpene synthase gene in wheat. It encodes a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes Î²-patchoulene formation with &lt;i&gt;E,E&lt;/i&gt;-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, thus named as TaPS. TaPS exhibits inducible expression in wheat in response to various elicitations. Particularly, alamethicin treatment strongly induces &lt;i&gt;TaPS&lt;/i&gt; gene expression and Î²-patchoulene accumulation in wheat. Overexpression of &lt;i&gt;TaPS&lt;/i&gt; in Arabidopsis successfully produces Î²-patchoulene, verifying the biochemical function of TaPS in planta. Furthermore, these transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibit resistance against herbivory by repelling beet armyworm larvae feeding, thereby indicating anti-herbivory activity of Î²-patchoulene. The catalytic mechanism of TaPS is also explored by homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Two key amino acids are identified to act in protonation and stability of intermediates and product formation. Taken together, one wheat sesquiterpene synthase is identified as Î²-patchoulene synthase. TaPS exhibits inducible gene expression and the sesquiterpene Î²-patchoulene is involved in repelling insect infestation.">

        <span class="abst" title="Agarwood (&lt;i&gt;Aquilaria&lt;/i&gt; spp.) fragrance and its origin in stress make it probably the most suitable model to study stress-induced aroma. Production being confined only to certain small pockets of South and Southeast Asia, agarwood is arguably the costliest wood in the world. Formation of fragrant agarwood resin is the outcome of complex biotic, abiotic, and physical stress on the &lt;i&gt;Aquilaria&lt;/i&gt; trees. The intricate mechanism by which some 150 odd fragrant molecules that constitute agarwood aroma is formed is still not clearly understood. The present review therefore aims to bring to focus this less known but highly valuable stress-induced aroma from Asia. Discussions on agarwood species, occurrence, distribution, formation, and products have been included as foundation. Although global trade in agarwood and its products is estimated at US$6 billion to US$8 billion, no reliable data are readily available in literature. Therefore, an effort has been made to review the current status of agarwood trade. The element of stress and its correlation to agarwood aroma is discussed in the subsequent sections. Natural agarwood formation as well as technologies and interventions in agarwood induction are stress-based (natural and artificial injury, insect and fungal attack, chemical induction). The molecular triggers are gradually coming to light as new studies are implicating jasmonate, LOX signaling, and other stress reaction routes as the source of agarwood aroma. This review therefore has strived to compile the information that is scattered across scientific as well as other authentic literature and update the reader on the current status. More information about the specific roles of other vital stressors like insects, abiotic, and genetic factors is eagerly awaited from ongoing and future research to further understand the unique fragrance of agarwood.">

        <span class="abst" title="In response to insect herbivory, poplar releases a blend of volatiles that plays important roles in plant defense. Although the volatile bouquet is highly complex and comprises several classes of compounds, it is dominated by mono- and sesquiterpenes. The most common precursors for mono- and sesquiterpenes, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (&lt;i&gt;E,E&lt;/i&gt;)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), respectively, are in general produced by homodimeric or heterodimeric &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-isopentenyl diphosphate synthases (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-IDSs) that belong to the family of prenyltransferases. To understand the molecular basis of herbivory-induced terpene formation in poplar, we investigated the &lt;i&gt;trans-IDS&lt;/i&gt; gene family in the western balsam poplar &lt;i&gt;Populus trichocarpa&lt;/i&gt;. Sequence comparisons suggested that this species possesses a single FPP synthase gene (&lt;i&gt;PtFPPS1&lt;/i&gt;) and four genes encoding two large subunits (&lt;i&gt;PtGPPS1.LSU&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PtGPPS2.LSU&lt;/i&gt;) and two small subunits (&lt;i&gt;PtGPPS.SSU1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PtGPPS.SSU2&lt;/i&gt;) of GPP synthases. Transcript accumulation of &lt;i&gt;PtGPPS1.LSU&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PtGPPS.SSU1&lt;/i&gt; was significantly upregulated upon leaf herbivory, while the expression of &lt;i&gt;PtFPPS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PtGPPS2.LSU&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PtGPPS.SSU2&lt;/i&gt; was not influenced by the herbivore treatment. Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of recombinant PtFPPS1, PtGPPS1.LSU, and PtGPPS2.LSU confirmed their respective IDS activities. Recombinant PtGPPS.SSU1 and PtGPPS.SSU2, however, had no enzymatic activity on their own, but PtGPPS.SSU1 enhanced the GPP synthase activities of PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS2.LSU in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS2.LSU in combination with PtGPPS.SSU1 may provide the substrate for herbivory-induced monoterpene formation in &lt;i&gt;P. trichocarpa&lt;/i&gt;. The sole FPP synthase PtFPPS1 likely produces FPP for both primary and specialized metabolism in this plant species.">

The strain ZS314&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; was able to produce reddish orange pigments at low temperatures, showing characteristics of carotenoids. To understand the biosynthetic potential of this strain, the genome was completely sequenced for data mining. The complete genome had 3,352,609 base pairs (bp), much smaller than most genomes of actinomycetes. Five biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were predicted in the genome, including a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of C50 carotenoid, and four additional BGCs of unknown oligosaccharide, salinixanthin, alkylresorcinol derivatives, and NRPS (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase) or amino acid-derived compounds. Further experimental characterization indicated that the strain may produce C.p.450-like carotenoids, supporting the genomic data analysis. A new xanthorhodopsin gene was discovered along with the analysis of the salinixanthin biosynthetic gene cluster. Since little is known about this genus, this work improves our understanding of its biosynthetic potential and provides opportunities for further investigation of natural products and strategies for adaptation to the extreme Antarctic environment.">

The interaction between &lt;i&gt;Platanus&lt;/i&gt; species and this insect pest has not yet been studied at the molecular level. Therefore, a recent study was conducted to compare the gene expression and metabolite profiles of &lt;i&gt;Platanus acerifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaves in response to &lt;i&gt;C. ciliata&lt;/i&gt; feeding damage after 24 and 48 h. We employed high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA- seq) to identify a total of 2,828 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after &lt;i&gt;C. ciliata&lt;/i&gt; feeding. In addition, 303 unigenes were found to be up-regulated at both time points. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed that monoterpenoid biosynthesis, the linoleic acid metabolism pathway, and alpha- linolenic acid metabolism were the most prominent pathways among the DEGs. Further analysis of the metabolite profiles showed that nine metabolites were significantly different before and after &lt;i&gt;C. ciliata&lt;/i&gt; damage. In addition, we analyzed DEGs detected in the &lt;i&gt;P. acerifolia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. ciliata&lt;/i&gt; interaction using Mapman. The terpene synthase gene family was also identified. We suggest that the results obtained from DEGs and metabolite analysis can provide important information for the identification of genes involved in the &lt;i&gt;P. acerifolia&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;C. ciliata&lt;/i&gt; interaction, which might be necessary for controlling &lt;i&gt;C. ciliata&lt;/i&gt; efficiently.">

Cymbidium goeringii consist with high economic value and characteristics include fragrance and multiple flower colors. Floral scent is one of the important strategies for ensuring fertilization. However, limited genetic data is available in this non-model plant, and little known about the molecular mechanism responsible for floral scent in this orchid. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and better understand the biological mechanisms of floral scents in this species. Present transcriptomic data provides basic information on the genes and enzymes related to and pathways involved in flower secondary metabolism in this plant.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, RNA sequencing analyses were performed to identify changes in gene expression and biological pathways related scent metabolism. Three cDNA libraries were obtained from three developmental floral stages: closed bud, half flowering stage and full flowering stage. Using Illumina technique 159,616,374 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 85,868 final unigenes (average length 1194â€‰nt), 33.85% of which were annotated in the NCBI non redundant protein database. Among this unigenes 36,082 were assigned to gene ontology and 23,164 were combined with COG groups. Total 33,417 unigenes were assigned in 127 pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. According these transcriptomic data we identified number of candidates genes which differentially expressed in different developmental stages of flower related to fragrance biosynthesis. In q-RT-PCR most of the fragrance related genes highly expressed in half flowering stage.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;RNA-seq and DEG data provided comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level that could be facilitate the molecular mechanisms of floral biosynthesis pathways in three developmental phase's flowers in Cymbidium goeringii, moreover providing useful information for further analysis on C. goeringii, and other plants of genus Cymbidium.">

We investigated gene expression changes combined with volatile profiling of ten samples from three developing organs: flower, leaf, and fruit. A total of 62 volatiles were identified with limonene and Î³-terpinene being the most abundant ones. Six volatiles were identified using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) that could be used as markers for distinguishing finger citron from other citrus species. RNA-Seq revealed 1,611,966,118 high quality clean reads that were assembled into 32,579 unigenes. From these a total of 58 terpene synthase (TPS) gene family members were identified and the spatial and temporal distribution of their transcripts was measured in developing organs. Transcript levels of transcription factor genes &lt;i&gt;AP2/ERF&lt;/i&gt; (251), &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; (169), &lt;i&gt;bZIP&lt;/i&gt; (76), &lt;i&gt;MYB&lt;/i&gt; (155), &lt;i&gt;NAC&lt;/i&gt; (184), and &lt;i&gt;WRKY&lt;/i&gt; (66) during finger citron development were also analyzed. From extracted subnetworks of three modules constructed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), thirteen &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes and fifteen transcription factors were suggested to be related to volatile terpenoid formation. These results provide a framework for future investigations into the identification and regulatory network of terpenoids in finger citron.">

Terpene synthases (TPSs) are the key enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of terpenes. Although some species were employed for the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family, limited information is available regarding the evolution, expansion, and retention mechanisms occurring in this gene family. We performed a genome-wide identification of the TPS family members in 50 sequenced genomes. Additionally, we also characterized the TPS family from aromatic spearmint and basil plants using RNA-Seq data. No TPSs were identified in algae genomes but the remaining plant species encoded various numbers of the family members ranging from 2 to 79 full-length TPSs. Some species showed lineage-specific expansion of certain subfamilies, which might have contributed toward species or ecotype divergence or environmental adaptation. A large-scale family expansion was observed mainly in dicot and monocot plants, which was accompanied by frequent domain loss. Both tandem and segmental duplication significantly contributed toward family expansion and expression divergence and played important roles in the survival of these expanded genes. Our data provide new insight into the TPS family expansion and evolution and suggest that TPSs might have originated from isoprenyl diphosphate synthase genes.">

However, it remains unclear how the initial conformation of GFPP is controlled, and which part(s) of the GFPP molecule are important for its fixation inside the substrate-binding pocket. Here, we present the first detailed analysis of the inherent atomic mobility in carbocation intermediates during sesterterpene biosynthesis. We identified two methyl groups as the least mobile of all the carbons of the carbocation intermediates in the first half of the cyclization cascade. Our analysis suggests that these two methyl groups are critical for the preorganization of GFPP in the biosynthetic pathways leading to sesterfisherol and quiannulatene.">

        <span class="abst" title="Monoterpenoids are a structurally diverse group of natural products with applications as pharmaceuticals, flavourings, fragrances, pesticides, and biofuels. Recent advances in synthetic biology offer new routes to this chemical diversity through the introduction of heterologous isoprenoid production pathways into engineered microorganisms. Due to the nature of the branched reaction mechanism, monoterpene synthases often produce multiple products when expressed in monoterpenoid production platforms. Rational engineering of terpene synthases is challenging due toÂ a lack of correlation between protein sequence and cyclisation reaction catalysed. Directed evolution offers an attractive alternative protein engineering strategy as limited prior sequence-function knowledge is required. However, directed evolution of terpene synthases is hampered by the lack of a convenient high-throughput screening assay for the detection of multiple volatile terpene products. Here we applied an automated pipeline for the screening of diverse monoterpene synthase libraries, employing robotic liquid handling platforms coupled to GC-MS, and automated data extraction. We used the pipeline to screen pinene synthase variant libraries, with mutations in three areas of plasticity, capable of producing multiple monoterpene products. We successfully identified variants with altered product profiles and demonstrated good agreement between the results of the automated screen and traditional shake-flask cultures. In addition, useful insights into the cyclisation reaction catalysed by pinene synthase were obtained, including the identification of positions with the highest level of plasticity, and the significance of region 2 in carbocation cyclisation. The results obtained will aid the prediction and design of novel terpene synthase activities towards clean monoterpenoid products.">

Surprisingly, terpene biosynthesis in this species has always been investigated in complex media, with unknown compounds possibly acting as carbon and nitrogen sources. Here, a defined medium was adapted for R. sphaeroides dark heterotrophic growth, and was used to investigate the conversion of different organic substrates into the reporter terpene amorphadiene. The amorphadiene synthase was cloned in R. sphaeroides, allowing its biosynthesis via the native 2-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway and, additionally, via a heterologous mevalonate one. The latter condition increased titers up to eightfold. Consequently, better yields and productivities to previously reported complex media cultivations were achieved. Productivity was further investigated under different cultivation conditions, including nitrogen and oxygen availability. This novel cultivation setup provided useful insight into the understanding of terpene biosynthesis in R. sphaeroides, allowing to better comprehend its dynamics and regulation during chemoheterotrophic cultivation.">

This is particularly evident in the case of monoterpenoid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the canonical terpene precursor geranyl diphosphate is tightly coupled to the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds essential for yeast viability. Here, we establish a synthetic orthogonal monoterpenoid pathway based on an alternative precursor, neryl diphosphate. We identify structural determinants of isomeric substrate selectivity in monoterpene synthases and engineer five different enzymes to accept the alternative substrate with improved efficiency and specificity. We combine the engineered enzymes with dynamic regulation of metabolic flux to harness the potential of the orthogonal substrate and improve the production of industrially-relevant monoterpenes by several-fold compared to the canonical pathway. This approach highlights the introduction of synthetic metabolism as an effective strategy for high-value compound production.">

Tryptophan-arginine-lysine-tyrosine (WRKY) transcription factors have been reported to play important roles in plant metabolism and development. In this study, a novel WRKY transcription factor named &lt;i&gt;OpWRKY3&lt;/i&gt; was isolated from &lt;i&gt;O. pumila&lt;/i&gt;, with full-length open reading frame (ORF) of 1128 bp, encoding 375 amino acids. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that OpWRKY3 shared the highest homology with VvWRKY30, and it is a significant feature belonging to group III. &lt;i&gt;OpWRKY3&lt;/i&gt; was responsive to various treatments, including gibberellin (GA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), methyl jasmonate (MJ), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA). Besides, &lt;i&gt;OpWRKY3&lt;/i&gt; is expressed predominantly in stems. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OpWRKY3 localized in the nucleus. The biomass of &lt;i&gt;OpWRKY3-SRDX&lt;/i&gt; transgenic hairy roots (S line) was visibly suppressed, while there were slight changes between overexpression of the &lt;i&gt;OpWRKY3&lt;/i&gt; line (OE line) and the control. In addition, the concentration and total production of camptothecin precursors including loganin and secologanin were significantly changed in both OE and S lines while total production of CPT was significantly changed in most transgenic lines. Thus, the present work revealed that &lt;i&gt;OpWRKY3&lt;/i&gt; may act as a regulator in the growth and development of &lt;i&gt;O. pumila&lt;/i&gt;, and in production of camptothecin and its precursors.">

Most &lt;i&gt;Thymus&lt;/i&gt; molecular research has focused on the determining the phylogenetic relationships between different species, but no published work has focused on the evolution of the transcriptome across the genus to elucidate genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Hence, in this study, the transcriptomes of five different &lt;i&gt;Thymus&lt;/i&gt; species were generated and analyzed to mine putative genes involved in thymol and carvacrol biosynthesis. High-throughput sequencing produced ~43 million high-quality reads per sample, which were assembled de novo using several tools, then further subjected to a quality evaluation. The best assembly for each species was used as queries to search within the UniProt, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and TF (Transcription Factors) databases. Mining the transcriptomes resulted in the identification of 592 single-copy orthogroups used for phylogenetic analysis. The data showed strongly support a close genetic relationship between &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thymus daenensis.&lt;/i&gt; Additionally, this study dates the speciation events between 1.5-2.1 and 9-10.2 MYA according to different methodologies.

We report the diversity of terpene profiles across samples bound for the Washington dispensary market. The remarkable degree of variation in terpene profiles ultimately results from action of a family of terpene synthase genes, only some of which have been described. Using a recently available genome assembly we describe 55 terpene synthases with genomic context, and tissue specific expression. The family is quite diverse from a protein similarity perspective, and subsets of the family are expressed in all tissues in the plant, including a set of root specific monoterpene synthases that could well have agronomic importance. Ultimately understanding and breeding for specific terpene profiles will require a good understanding of the gene family that underlies it. We intend for this work to serve as a foundation for that.">

        <span class="abst" title="Sesquiterpenoids are a large class of natural compounds offering manifold properties valuable for food, cosmetics, agriculture, and pharma industry. Production in microorganisms is a sustainable approach to provide sesquiterpenoids for research and industrial use independent of their natural sources. This requires the functional transfer of the respective biocatalytic pathways in an adequate host microorganism offering a sufficient supply of precursors that is ideally adjusted to the individual demand of the recombinant biosynthesis route. The phototrophic purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus offers unique physiological properties that are favorable for biosynthesis of hydrophobic terpenes. Under phototrophic conditions, it develops a large intracytoplasmic membrane suitable for hosting membrane-bound enzymes and metabolites of respective biosynthetic pathways. In addition, Rhodobacter harbors an intrinsic carotenoid biosynthesis that can be engineered toward the production of foreign terpenes. Here, we evaluate R. capsulatus as host for the production of plant sesquiterpenoids under phototrophic conditions using patchoulol and valencene as a proof of concept. The heterologous expression of patchoulol synthase PcPS from Pogostemon cablin as well as the valencene synthases CsVS from Citrus sinensis and CnVS from Callitropsis nootkatensis led to the production of the respective sesquiterpenoids in R. capsulatus. To analyze, if gradually adjustable formation of the key precursor farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) is beneficial for sesquiterpene synthesis under phototrophic conditions, the intrinsic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway genes as well as the heterologous mevalonate pathway genes were modularly expressed in various combinations. To this end, different plasmids and chromosomally integrated expression tools were developed harboring the strong and tightly controlled P nif promoter for heterologous gene expression. Notably, comparative studies identified a distinct combination of precursor biosynthetic genes as best-performing setup for each of the tested sesquiterpene synthases. In summary, we could demonstrate that R. capsulatus is a promising alternative platform organism that is suited for sustainable sesquiterpenoid formation under phototrophic cultivation conditions. A modular engineering of R. capsulatus strains via tailored co-expression of FPP biosynthetic genes further allowed adaptation of sesquiterpene precursor formation to its catalytic conversion by different plant terpene synthases.">

In contrast to model plants, reports on HIPV formation and function in crops are limited. Tea (&lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt;) is an important crop in China. Î±-Farnesene is a common HIPV produced in tea plants in response to different herbivore attacks. In this study, a &lt;i&gt;C. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; Î±-farnesene synthase (CsAFS) was isolated, cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. The CsAFS recombinant protein produced in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was able to transform farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into Î±-farnesene and also convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to Î²-ocimene &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, transient expression analysis in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; plants indicated that CsAFS was located in the cytoplasm and could convert FPP to Î±-farnesene in plants. Wounding, to simulate herbivore damage, activated jasmonic acid (JA) formation, which significantly enhanced the &lt;i&gt;CsAFS&lt;/i&gt; expression level and Î±-farnesene content. This suggested that herbivore-derived wounding induced Î±-farnesene formation in tea leaves. Furthermore, the emitted Î±-farnesene might act as a signal to activate antibacterial-related factors in neighboring undamaged tea leaves. This research advances our understanding of the formation and signaling roles of common HIPVs in crops such as tea plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="Switchgrass (&lt;i&gt;Panicum virgatum&lt;/i&gt; L.), a perennial C4 grass, represents an important species in natural and anthropogenic grasslands of North America. Its resilience to abiotic and biotic stress has made switchgrass a preferred bioenergy crop. However, little is known about the mechanisms of resistance of switchgrass against pathogens and herbivores. Volatile compounds such as terpenes have important activities in plant direct and indirect defense. Here, we show that switchgrass leaves emit blends of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes upon feeding by the generalist insect herbivore &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera frugiperda&lt;/i&gt; (fall armyworm) and in a systemic response to the treatment of roots with defense hormones. Belowground application of methyl jasmonate also induced the release of volatile terpenes from roots. To correlate the emission of terpenes with the expression and activity of their corresponding biosynthetic genes, we identified a gene family of 44 monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases (mono- and sesqui-TPSs) of the type-a, type-b, type-g, and type-e subfamilies, of which 32 TPSs were found to be functionally active &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The TPS genes are distributed over the K and N subgenomes with clusters occurring on several chromosomes. Synteny analysis revealed syntenic networks for approximately 30-40% of the switchgrass TPS genes in the genomes of &lt;i&gt;Panicum hallii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Setaria italica&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Sorghum bicolor&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting shared TPS ancestry in the common progenitor of these grass lineages. Eighteen switchgrass TPS genes were substantially induced upon insect and hormone treatment and the enzymatic products of nine of these genes correlated with compounds of the induced volatile blends. In accordance with the emission of volatiles, TPS gene expression was induced systemically in response to belowground treatment, whereas this response was not observed upon aboveground feeding of &lt;i&gt;S. frugiperda.&lt;/i&gt; Our results demonstrate complex above and belowground responses of induced volatile terpene metabolism in switchgrass and provide a framework for more detailed investigations of the function of terpenes in stress resistance in this monocot crop.">

The biotechnological production of such fragrant sesquiterpenes is a promising alternative towards sustainability; nevertheless, product recovery from fermentation is one of the main constraints. In an effort to improve the (+)-zizaene recovery from a metabolically-engineered &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, we developed an integrated bioprocess by coupling fermentation and (+)-zizaene recovery using adsorber extractants. Initially, (+)-zizaene volatilization was confirmed from cultivations with no extractants but application of liquid-liquid phase partitioning cultivation (LLPPC) improved (+)-zizaene recovery nearly 4-fold. Furthermore, solid-liquid phase partitioning cultivation (SLPPC) was evaluated by screening polymeric adsorbers, where Diaion HP20 reached the highest recovery. Bioprocess was scaled up to 2 L bioreactors and in situ recovery configurations integrated to fermentation were evaluated. External recovery configuration was performed with an expanded bed adsorption column and improved (+)-zizaene titers 2.5-fold higher than LLPPC. Moreover, internal recovery configuration (IRC) further enhanced the (+)-zizaene titers 2.2-fold, whereas adsorption velocity was determined as critical parameter for recovery efficiency. Consequently, IRC improved the (+)-zizaene titer 8.4-fold and productivity 3-fold from our last report, achieving a (+)-zizaene titer of 211.13 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and productivity of 3.2 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoids comprise tens of thousands of small molecule natural products that are widely distributed across all domains of life. Plants produce by far the largest array of terpenoids with various roles in development and chemical ecology. Driven by selective pressure to adapt to their specific ecological niche, individual species form only a fraction of the myriad plant terpenoids, typically representing unique metabolite blends. Terpene synthase (TPS) enzymes are the gatekeepers in generating terpenoid diversity by catalyzing complex carbocation-driven cyclization, rearrangement, and elimination reactions that enable the transformation of a few acyclic prenyl diphosphate substrates into a vast chemical library of hydrocarbon and, for a few enzymes, oxygenated terpene scaffolds. The seven currently defined clades (a-h) forming the plant TPS family evolved from ancestral triterpene synthase- and prenyl transferase-type enzymes through repeated events of gene duplication and subsequent loss, gain, or fusion of protein domains and further functional diversification. Lineage-specific expansion of these TPS clades led to variable family sizes that may range from a single TPS gene to families of more than 100 members that may further function as part of modular metabolic networks to maximize the number of possible products. Accompanying gene family expansion, the TPS family shows a profound functional plasticity, where minor active site alterations can dramatically impact product outcome, thus enabling the emergence of new functions with minimal investment in evolving new enzymes. This article reviews current knowledge on the functional diversity and molecular evolution of the plant TPS family that underlies the chemical diversity of bioactive terpenoids across the plant kingdom.">

Using RNA-Seq, we discovered that the second-instar male larva (SM) of the white wax insect, Ericerus pela, have 5,968 and 8,620 differentially expressed transcripts compared with the second-instar female larva (SF) and the first-instar male larva (FM), respectively. The expression levels of genes involved in the apoptosis of old tissues and the reconstruction of new ones in the SM significantly enhanced, while the SF mainly has enhanced expression levels of anabolic genes such as chitin. We predicted that the second-instar larvae are the developmental origin of sexual dimorphic metamorphosis. Meanwhile, in the juvenile hormone (JH) metabolic pathway, CYP15A1 and JH esterase (JHE) are differentially expressed; and in the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) metabolic pathway, CYP307A1, CYP314A1, and CYP18A1 are differentially expressed. In the SM, the expression levels of CYP307A1 and CYP314A1 are significantly increased, whereas the expression level of CYP18A1 is significantly decreased; in the SF, the expression levels of the above genes are opposite to that of the SM. Expression trends of RNA-seq is consistent with the expression level of qRT-PCR, and seven of them are highly correlated (R â‰¥ 0.610) and four are moderately correlated (0.588 â‰¥ R â‰¥ 0.542).">

        <span class="abst" title="Tanshinones are important bioactive components in Salvia miltiorrhiza and mainly accumulate in the periderms of mature roots. Tanshinone biosynthesis is a complicated process, and little is known about the third stage of the pathway. To investigate potential genes that are responsible for tanshinone biosynthesis, we conducted transcriptome profiling analysis of two S. miltiorrhiza cultivars. Differential expression analysis provided 2,149 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for further analysis. GO and KEGG analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was further performed to identify a &quot;cyan&quot; module associated with tanshinone biosynthesis. In this module, 25 cytochromes P450 (CYPs), three 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2OGDs), one short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases (SDRs) and eight transcription factors were found to be likely involved in tanshinone biosynthesis. Among these CYPs, 14 CYPs have been reported previously, and 11 CYPs were identified in this study. Expression analysis showed that four newly identified CYPs were upregulated upon application of MeJA, suggesting their possible roles in tanshinone biosynthesis. Overall, this study not only identified candidate genes involved in tanshinone biosynthesis but also provided a basis for characterization of genes involved in important active ingredients of other traditional Chinese medicinal plants.">

Basic information on lily floral scent compounds has been obtained for only a few accessions, and little is known about Lilium aroma types, the terpene synthase genes that may play roles in the production of key volatiles, or the range of monoterpenes that these genes produce. In this study, 41 cultivars were analyzed for volatile emissions, and a total of 46 individual volatile compounds were identified, 16 for the first time in lilies. Lily accessions were classified into six groups according to the composition of major scent components: faint-scented, cool, fruity, musky, fruity-honey, and lily. Monoterpenes were one of the main groups of volatiles identified, and attention was focused on terpene synthase (TPS) genes, which encode enzymes that catalyze the last steps in monoterpene synthesis. Thirty-two candidate monoterpene synthase cDNAs were obtained from 66 lily cultivars, and 64 SNPs were identified. Two InDels were also shown to result from variable splicing, and sequence analysis suggested that different transcripts arose from the same gene. All identified nucleotide substitution sites were highly correlated with the amounts of myrcene emitted, and InDel site 230 was highly correlated with the emission of all major monoterpenoid components, especially (E)-Î²-ocimene. Heterologous expression of five cDNAs cloned from faint-scented and strong-scented lilies showed that their corresponding enzymes could convert geranyl diphosphate to (E)-Î²-ocimene, Î±-pinene, and limonene. The findings from this study provide a major resource for the assessment of lily scent volatiles and will be helpful in breeding of improved volatile components.">

        <span class="abst" title="Capsidiol is a sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin produced in Nicotiana and Capsicum species in response to pathogen attack. Whether capsidiol plays a defensive role and how its biosynthesis is regulated in the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata when the plant is attacked by Alternaria alternata (tobacco pathotype), a notorious necrotrophic fungus causing brown spot disease, are unknown. Transcriptome analysis indicated that a metabolic switch to sesquiterpene biosynthesis occurred in young leaves of N. attenuata after A. alternata inoculation: many genes leading to sesquiterpene production were strongly up-regulated, including the capsidiol biosynthetic genes 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) and 5-epi-aristolochene hydroxylase (EAH). Consistently, the level of capsidiol was increased dramatically in young leaves after fungal inoculation, from not detectable in mock control to 50.68Â±3.10 Âµg g-1 fresh leaf at 3 d post-inoculation. Capsidiol-reduced or capsidiol-depleted plants, which were generated by silencing EAHs or EASs by virus-induced gene silencing, were more susceptible to the fungus. In addition, this sesquiterpene when purified from infected plants exhibited strong anti-fungal activities against A. alternata in vitro. Furthermore, an ERF2-like transcription factor was found to positively regulate capsidiol production and plant resistance through the direct transactivation of a capsidiol biosynthetic gene, EAS12. Taken together, our results demonstrate that capsidiol, a phytoalexin highly accumulated in N. attenuata plants in response to A. alternata infection, plays an important role in pathogen resistance independent of jasmonate and ethylene signaling pathways, and its biosynthesis is transcriptionally regulated by an ERF2-like transcription factor.">

A previous study indicated that S. brachiariae had antifungal activity; however, limited genomic information restrains further study. Therefore, we sequenced the genome of S. brachiariae and compared it with the genome of S. oryzae to identify differences between a Sarocladium plant pathogen and an endophyte.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, we reported a gapless genome sequence of a newly identified endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. The genome of S. brachiariae is 31.86â€‰Mb, with a contig N50 of 3.27â€‰Mb and 9903 protein coding genes. Phylogenomic analysis based on single copy orthologous genes provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of S. brachiariae and its closest species was identified as S. oryzae. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that S. brachiaria has 14.9% more plant cell wall degradation related CAZymes to S. oryzae, and 33.3% more fungal cell wall degradation related CAZymes, which could explain the antifungal activity of S. brachiaria. Based on Antibiotics &amp; Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) analysis, we identified a contact helvolic acid biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for the first time in S. oryzae. However, S. brachiaria had seven fewer terpene gene clusters, including helvolic acid BGC, compared with S. oryzae and this may be associated with adaptation to an endophytic lifestyle. Synteny analysis of polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and hybrid (PKS-NRPS) gene clusters between S. brachiariae and S. oryzae revealed that just 37.5% of tested clusters have good synteny, while 63.5% have no or poor synteny. This indicated that the S. brachiariae could potentially synthesize a variety of unknown-function secondary metabolites, which may play an important role in adaptation to its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The data provided a better understanding of the Sarocladium brachiariae genome. Further comparative genomic analysis provided insight into the genomic basis of its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.">

Some initial gene expression experiments have been performed from strains of this plant species that contrasted in cannabinoid production, however the present knowledge about detailed trichome transcriptomics in this species is limited. An extensive transcriptome atlas was generated by RNA sequencing using root, shoot, flower and trichome tissues from a female plant strain (Cannbio-2) and was enhanced with the addition of vegetative and reproductive tissues from a male cannabis plant. Differential gene expression analysis identified genes preferentially expressed in different tissues. Detailed trichomics was performed from extractions specifically from glandular trichomes as well as female floral tissues at varying developmental stages, to identify stage-specific differentially expressed genes. Candidate genes involved in terpene and cannabinoid synthesis were identified and the majority were found to have an abundant expression in trichomes. The comprehensive transcriptome is a significant resource in cannabis for further research of functional genomics to improve the yield of specialised metabolites with high pharmacological value.">

This includes pharmacologically useful plastidic terpenoids such as p-menthane monoterpenoids, cannabinoids, paclitaxel (taxolÂ®), and ingenol mebutate which are derived from the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, as well as cytosolic terpenoids such as thapsigargin and artemisinin produced through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. We further provide a review of the MEP and MVA precursor pathways which supply the carbon skeletons for the downstream transformations yielding these medically significant natural products.">

We performed a genome-wide association study for squalene in rice using 1.6 million high-quality SNPs extracted from 295 accessions' resequencing data. The candidate gene locus Os09g0319800-an orthologue of terpene synthase in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;-showed up as the most likely candidate gene amongst the identified loci.

        <span class="abst" title="Terpene synthases (TPSs) are pivotal enzymes for the production of diverse terpenes, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. In our recent studies, dictyostelid social amoebae, also known as cellular slime molds, were found to contain TPS genes for making volatile terpenes. For comparison, here we investigated Physarum polycephalum, a plasmodial slime mold also known as acellular amoeba. Plasmodia of P. polycephalum grown on agar plates were found to release a mixture of volatile terpenoids consisting of four major sesquiterpenes (Î±-muurolene, (E)-Î²-caryophyllene, two unidentified sesquiterpenoids) and the monoterpene linalool. There were no qualitative differences in terpenoid composition at two stages of young plasmodia. To understand terpene biosynthesis, we analyzed the transcriptome and genome sequences of P. polycephalum and identified four TPS genes designated PpolyTPS1-PpolyTPS4. They share 28-73% of sequence identities. Full-length cDNAs for the four TPS genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli to produce recombinant proteins, which were tested for sesquiterpene synthase and monoterpene synthase activities. While neither PpolyTPS2 nor PpolyTPS3 was active, PpolyTPS1 and PpolyTPS4 were able to produce sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes from the respective substrates farnesyl diphosphate and geranyl diphosphate. By comparing the volatile profile of P. polycephalum plasmodia and the in vitro products of PpolyTPS1 and PpolyTPS4, it was concluded that most sesquiterpenoids emitted from P. polycephalum were attributed to PpolyTPS4. Phylogenetic analysis placed the four PpolyTPSs genes into two groups: PpolyTPS1 and PpolyTPS4 being one group that was clustered with the TPSs from the dictyostelid social amoeba and PpolyTPS2 and PpolyTPS3 being the other group that showed closer relatedness to bacterial TPSs. The biological role of the volatile terpenoids produced by the plasmodia of P. polycephalum is discussed.">

They possess potent and specific biological activity in multiple assays and against diseases, including cancer and malaria as notable examples. Although the number of characterized terpenoid molecules is huge, our knowledge of how they are biosynthesized is limited, particularly when compared to the well-studied thiotemplate assembly lines. Bacteria have only recently been recognized as having the genetic potential to biosynthesize a large number of complex terpenoids, but our current ability to associate genetic potential with molecular structure is severely restricted. The canonical terpene biosynthetic pathway uses a single enzyme to form a cyclized hydrocarbon backbone followed by modifications with a suite of tailoring enzymes that can generate dozens of different products from a single backbone. This functional promiscuity of terpene biosynthetic pathways renders terpene biosynthesis susceptible to rational pathway engineering using the latest developments in the field of synthetic biology. These engineered pathways will not only facilitate the rational creation of both known and novel terpenoids, their development will deepen our understanding of a significant branch of biosynthesis. The biosynthetic insights gained will likely empower a greater degree of engineering proficiency for non-natural terpene biosynthetic pathways and pave the way towards the biotechnological production of high value terpenoids.">

        <span class="abst" title="Salinity is one of the major factors negatively affecting crop productivity. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are involved in salicylic acid (SA) mediated cellular reactive oxygen species homeostasis in response to different stresses, including salinity. Therefore, the effect of NaCl, NaClâ€‰+â€‰SA and SA treatments on different photosynthesis-related parameters and wax metabolites were studied in the Jatropha curcas WRKY (JcWRKY) overexpressing tobacco lines. JcWRKY transgenics showed improved photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration/ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration ratio (Ci/Ca ratio), electron transport rate (ETR), photosynthesis efficiency (Fv/Fm), photochemical quenching (qP), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and quantum yield of PSII electron transport (Î¦PSII) in response to salinity stress, while exogenous SA application had subtle effect on these parameters. Alkane, the major constituent of wax showed maximum accumulation in transgenics exposed to NaCl. Other wax components like fatty alcohol, carboxylic acid and fatty acid were also higher in transgenics with NaClâ€‰+â€‰SA and SA treatments. Interestingly, the transgenics showed a higher number of open stomata in treated plants as compared to wild type (WT), indicating less perception of stress by the transgenics. Improved salinity tolerance in JcWRKY overexpressing tobacco transgenics is associated with photosynthetic efficiency and wax accumulation, mediated by efficient SA signalling. The transgenics showed differential regulation of genes related to photosynthesis (NtCab40, NtLhcb5 and NtRca1), wax accumulation (NtWIN1) and stomatal regulation (NtMUTE, NtMYB-like, NtNCED3-2 and NtPIF3). The present study indicates that JcWRKY is a potential TF facilitating improved photosynthesis with the wax metabolic co-ordination in transgenics during stress.">

        <span class="abst" title="Leaves of C. porrectum are rich in essential oils containing monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and aromatic compounds, but the molecular mechanism of terpenoid biosynthesis in C. porrectum is still unclear. In this paper, the differences in the contents and compositions of terpenoids among three chemotypes were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Furthermore, the differential expression of gene transcripts in the leaf tissues of the three C. porrectum chemotypes were analyzed through a comparison of full-length transcriptomes and expression profiles. The essential oil of the three C. porrectum chemotypes leaves was mainly composed of monoterpenes. In the full-length transcriptome of C. porrectum, 104,062 transcripts with 306,337,921 total bp, an average length of 2944 bp, and an N50 length of 5449 bp, were obtained and 94025 transcripts were annotated. In the eucalyptol and linalool chemotype, the camphor and eucalyptol chemotype, and the camphor and linalool chemotype comparison groups, 21, 22 and 18 terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes were identified respectively. Three monoterpene synthase genes, CpTPS3, CpTPS5 and CpTPS9, were upregulated in the eucalyptol chemotype compared to the linalool chemotype and camphor chemotype. CpTPS1 was upregulated in the camphor chemotype compared to the linalool chemotype and the eucalyptol chemotype. CpTPS4 was upregulated in the linalool chemotype compared to the camphor chemotype and the eucalyptol chemotype. Different unigenes had different expression levels among the three chemotypes, but the unigene expression levels of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4phosphate (MEP) pathway were generally higher than those of the mevalonate acid (MVA) pathway. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR(qRT-PCR) further validated these expression levels. The present study provides new clues for the functional exploration of the terpenoid synthesis mechanism and key genes in different chemotypes of C. porrectum.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Rhodococci are industrially important soil-dwelling Gram-positive bacteria that are well known for both nitrile hydrolysis and oxidative metabolism of aromatics. Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC BAA-870 is capable of metabolising a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic nitriles and amides. The genome of the organism was sequenced and analysed in order to better understand this whole cell biocatalyst. RESULTS:The genome of R. rhodochrous ATCC BAA-870 is the first Rhodococcus genome fully sequenced using Nanopore sequencing. The circular genome contains 5.9 megabase pairs (Mbp) and includes a 0.53 Mbp linear plasmid, that together encode 7548 predicted protein sequences according to BASys annotation, and 5535 predicted protein sequences according to RAST annotation. The genome contains numerous oxidoreductases, 15 identified antibiotic and secondary metabolite gene clusters, several terpene and nonribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, as well as 6 putative clusters of unknown type. The 0.53 Mbp plasmid encodes 677 predicted genes and contains the nitrile converting gene cluster, including a nitrilase, a low molecular weight nitrile hydratase, and an enantioselective amidase. Although there are fewer biotechnologically relevant enzymes compared to those found in rhodococci with larger genomes, such as the well-known Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, the abundance of transporters in combination with the myriad of enzymes found in strain BAA-870 might make it more suitable for use in industrially relevant processes than other rhodococci. CONCLUSIONS:The sequence and comprehensive description of the R. rhodochrous ATCC BAA-870 genome will facilitate the additional exploitation of rhodococci for biotechnological applications, as well as enable further characterisation of this model organism. The genome encodes a wide range of enzymes, many with unknown substrate specificities supporting potential applications in biotechnology, including nitrilases, nitrile hydratase, monooxygenases, cytochrome P450s, reductases, proteases, lipases, and transaminases.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Previous reports have mainly focused on the volatiles in citrus fruits, and there have been few reports about the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers. However, citrus leaves and flowers are also rich in volatile compounds with unique aromas. Here, to investigate the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers, volatile profiling was performed on leaves from 62 germplasms and flowers from 25 germplasms. RESULTS:In total, 196 and 82 volatile compounds were identified from leaves of 62 citrus germplasms and flowers of 25 citrus germplasms, respectively. The dominant volatile terpenoids were more diverse in citrus leaves than in peels. A total of 34 volatile terpenoids were commonly detected in the leaves of at least 20 germplasms, among which 31 were overaccumulated in the leaves of wild or semiwild germplasms. This result was consistent with the high expression levels of five genes and one key gene of the mevalonate and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) biosynthetic pathways, respectively, as well as the low expression levels of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase of the MEP pathway, relative to the levels in cultivars. Fully open flowers showed increased levels of four terpene alcohols and a decrease in sabinene content compared with balloon-stage flowers, especially in sweet orange. A monoterpene synthase gene was identified and functionally characterized as a sabinene synthase in vitro. CONCLUSIONS:Collectively, our results suggest that 31 important terpenoids are abundant in wild or semiwild citrus germplasms, possibly because of a negative effect of domestication on the volatiles in citrus leaves. The sweet smell of fully open flowers may be attributed to increased levels of four terpene alcohols. In addition, a sabinene synthase gene was identified by combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses.">

With the discovery of the quorum sensing phenomenon in bioluminescent bacteria in the late 1960s, it became clear that intraspecies and interspecies communications and social behaviors also occur in simple microorganisms such as bacteria. However, at that time, it was difficult to imagine how such small organisms-invisible to the naked eye-could influence the behavior and wellbeing of the larger, more complex and visible organisms they colonize. Now that we know this information, the challenge is to identify the myriad of bacterial chemical signals and communication networks that regulate the life of what can be defined, in a whole, as a meta-organism. In this review, we described the transkingdom crosstalk between bacteria, insects, and plants from an ecological perspective, providing some paradigmatic examples. Second, we reviewed what is known about the genetic and biochemical bases of the bacterial chemical communication with other organisms and how explore the semiochemical potential of a bacterium can be explored. Finally, we illustrated how bacterial semiochemicals managing the transkingdom communication may be exploited from a biotechnological point of view.">

In this work, we present evidence for the significant role of the active site's residues in CotB2 on the reaction energetics using quantum mechanical calculations in an active site cluster model. The results revealed the significant effect of the active site residues on the relative electronic energy of the intermediates and transition state structures with respect to gas phase data.

Totally 80 TPS-like genes were identified. Twenty-three CsTPS genes possessed a complete coding sequence and most likely were functional. The remaining 57 in the currently available database lack essential gene structure or full-length transcripts. Distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns of CsTPS genes were found in tea plants. 17 genes were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions. The other 17 were predominantly expressed in leaves whereas additional eight were primarily expressed in flowers. Under the treatments of cold acclimation, salt and polyethylene glycol, CsTPS67, -69 and -71 were all suppressed and the inhibited expression of many others were found in multiple stress treatments. However, methyl jasmonate resulted in the enhanced expression of the majority of CsTPS genes. These transcription data were largely validated using qPCR. Moreover, volatile terpenoid profiling with leaves, flowers and stress-treated plants revealed a general association between the abundances of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids and some CsTPS genes. These results provide vital information for future studies on CsTPS regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Grape berry ripening is influenced by climate, the main component of the &quot;terroir&quot; of a place. Light and temperature are major factors in the vineyard that affect berry development and fruit metabolite composition. RESULTS:To better understand the effect of &quot;place&quot; on transcript abundance during the late stages of berry ripening, Cabernet Sauvignon berries grown in Bordeaux and Reno were compared at similar sugar levels (19 to 26 Â°Brix (total soluble solids)). Day temperatures were warmer and night temperatures were cooler in Reno. Â°Brix was lower in Bordeaux berries compared to Reno at maturity levels considered optimum for harvest. RNA-Seq analysis identified 5528 differentially expressed genes between Bordeaux and Reno grape skins at 22Â°Brix. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis for all expressed transcripts for all four Â°Brix levels measured indicated that the majority (75%) of transcript expression differed significantly between the two locations. Top gene ontology categories for the common transcript sets were translation, photosynthesis, DNA metabolism and catabolism. Top gene ontology categories for the differentially expressed genes at 22Â°Brix involved response to stimulus, biosynthesis and response to stress. Some differentially expressed genes encoded terpene synthases, cell wall enzymes, kinases, transporters, transcription factors and photoreceptors. Most circadian clock genes had higher transcript abundance in Bordeaux. Bordeaux berries had higher transcript abundance with differentially expressed genes associated with seed dormancy, light, auxin, ethylene signaling, powdery mildew infection, phenylpropanoid, carotenoid and terpenoid metabolism, whereas Reno berries were enriched with differentially expressed genes involved in water deprivation, cold response, ABA signaling and iron homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS:Transcript abundance profiles in the berry skins at maturity were highly dynamic. RNA-Seq analysis identified a smaller (25% of total) common core set of ripening genes that appear not to depend on rootstock, vineyard management, plant age, soil and climatic conditions. Much of the gene expression differed between the two locations and could be associated with multiple differences in environmental conditions that may have affected the berries in the two locations; some of these genes may be potentially controlled in different ways by the vinegrower to adjust final berry composition and reach a desired result.">

These events have mainly been studied in model plants, rather than crop plants. Our study showed that tea green leafhopper (Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda), a major pest infesting tea attack significantly induced the emission of geraniol from tea leaves, but did not affect the crude enzyme activity of geraniol synthase in tea leaves. An enzyme extract of E. (M.) onukii specifically produced geraniol from geraniol diphosphate. Furthermore, a terpene synthase (EoTPS) was isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This terpene synthase was able to convert geraniol diphosphate to geraniol in vitro. In addition, geraniol had in vitro ability to inhibit the growth of Acinetobacter johnsonii that is endobacterial isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This information illustrates that elicitors from piercing-sucking insects can induce the formation of volatiles from crop plants and advances our understanding of the roles of plant volatiles in the interaction among crops-insects-microorganisms.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:(+)-Nootkatone is a highly valued sesquiterpenoid compound, exhibiting a typical grapefruit aroma and various desired biological activities for use as aromatics and pharmaceuticals. The high commercial demand of (+)-nootkatone is predominately met by chemical synthesis, which entails the use of environmentally harmful reagents. Efficient synthesis of (+)-nootkatone via biotechnological approaches is thus urgently needed to satisfy its industrial demand. However, there are only a limited number of studies that report the de novo synthesis of (+)-nootkatone from simple carbon sources in microbial cell factories, and with relatively low yield. RESULTS:As the direct precursor of (+)-nootkatone biosynthesis, (+)-valencene was first produced in large quantities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by overexpressing (+)-valencene synthase CnVS of Callitropsis nootkatensis in combination with various mevalonate pathway (MVA) engineering strategies, including the expression of CnVS and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (ERG20) as a fused protein, overexpression of a truncated form of the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (tHMG1), and downregulating the squalene synthase enzyme (ERG9). These approaches altogether brought the production of (+)-valencene to 217.95Â mg/L. Secondly, we addressed the (+)-valencene oxidation by overexpressing the Hyoscyamus muticus premnaspirodiene oxygenase (HPO) variant (V482I/A484I) and cytochrome P450 reductase (ATR1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. However, (+)-valencene was predominantly oxidized to Î²-nootkatol and only minor amounts of (+)-nootkatone (9.66Â mg/L) were produced. We further tackled the oxidation of Î²-nootkatol to (+)-nootkatone by screening various dehydrogenases. Our results showed that the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily dehydrogenases ZSD1 of Zingiber zerumbet and ABA2 of Citrus sinensis were capable of effectively catalyzing Î²-nootkatol oxidation to (+)-nootkatone. The yield of (+)-nootkatone increased to 59.78Â mg/L and 53.48Â mg/L by additional overexpression of ZSD1 and ABA2, respectively. CONCLUSION:We successfully constructed the (+)-nootaktone biosynthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae by overexpressing the (+)-valencene synthase CnVS, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase HPO, and SDR family dehydrogenases combined with the MVA pathway engineering, providing a solid basis for the whole-cell production of (+)-nootkatone. The two effective SDR family dehydrogenases tested in this study will serve as valuable enzymatic tools in further optimizing (+)-nootkatone production.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Rhodosporidium toruloides has emerged as a promising host for the production of bioproducts from lignocellulose, in part due to its ability to grow on lignocellulosic feedstocks, tolerate growth inhibitors, and co-utilize sugars and lignin-derived monomers. Ent-kaurene derivatives have a diverse range of potential applications from therapeutics to novel resin-based materials. RESULTS:The Design, Build, Test, and Learn (DBTL) approach was employed to engineer production of the non-native diterpene ent-kaurene in R. toruloides. Following expression of kaurene synthase (KS) in R. toruloides in the first DBTL cycle, a key limitation appeared to be the availability of the diterpene precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Further DBTL cycles were carried out to select an optimal GGPP synthase and to balance its expression with KS, requiring two of the strongest promoters in R. toruloides, ANT (adenine nucleotide translocase) and TEF1 (translational elongation factor 1) to drive expression of the KS from Gibberella fujikuroi and a mutant version of an FPP synthase from Gallus gallus that produces GGPP. Scale-up of cultivation in a 2 L bioreactor using a corn stover hydrolysate resulted in an ent-kaurene titer of 1.4Â g/L. CONCLUSION:This study builds upon previous work demonstrating the potential of R. toruloides as a robust and versatile host for the production of both mono- and sesquiterpenes, and is the first demonstration of the production of a non-native diterpene in this organism.">

Pearson correlation analysis resulted in genes to metabolites network.

        <span class="abst" title="The prokaryotic phylum Cyanobacteria are some of the oldest known photosynthetic organisms responsible for the oxygenation of the earth. Cyanobacterial species have been recognised as a prosperous source of bioactive secondary metabolites with antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and/or anticancer activities. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs/P450s) contribute to the production and diversity of various secondary metabolites. To better understand the metabolic potential of cyanobacterial species, we have carried out comprehensive analyses of P450s, predicted secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), and P450s located in secondary metabolite BGCs. Analysis of the genomes of 114 cyanobacterial species identified 341 P450s in 88 species, belonging to 36 families and 79 subfamilies. In total, 770 secondary metabolite BGCs were found in 103 cyanobacterial species. Only 8% of P450s were found to be part of BGCs. Comparative analyses with other bacteria Bacillus, Streptomyces and mycobacterial species have revealed a lower number of P450s and BGCs and a percentage of P450s forming part of BGCs in cyanobacterial species. A mathematical formula presented in this study revealed that cyanobacterial species have the highest gene-cluster diversity percentage compared to Bacillus and mycobacterial species, indicating that these diverse gene clusters are destined to produce different types of secondary metabolites. The study provides fundamental knowledge of P450s and those associated with secondary metabolism in cyanobacterial species, which may illuminate their value for the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries.">

        <span class="abst" title="Seed vigor is a key factor that determines the quality of seeds, which is of great significance for agricultural production, with the potential to promote growth and productivity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and genetic basis for seed vigor remain unknown. High-density genetic linkage mapping is an effective method for genomic study and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In this study, a high-density genetic map was constructed from a 148 BC4F3 population cross between 'M03' and 'M08' strains based on specific-locus amplified fragment (SLAF) sequencing. The constructed high-density genetic linkage map (HDGM) included 3876 SNP markers on ten chromosomes covering 2413.25 cM in length, with a mean distance between markers of 0.62 cM. QTL analysis was performed on four sweet corn germination traits that are related to seed vigor under artificial aging conditions. A total of 18 QTLs were identified in two seasons. Interestingly, a stable QTL was detected in two seasons on chromosome 10-termed qGR10-within an interval of 1.37 Mb. Within this interval, combined with gene annotation, we found four candidate genes (GRMZM2G074309, GRMZM2G117319, GRMZM2G465812, and GRMZM2G343519) which may be related to seed vigor after artificial aging.">

Using Aspergillus oryzae as a heterologous host for gene expression, the activity of several sesquiterpene synthases were investigated, highlighting one atypical sesquiterpene synthase apparently capable of catalysing the 1,11 and subsequent 2,10 ring closures, which primes the synthesis of the distinctive structure of caryophyllene derivatives. Co-expression of the cyclase with an FAD oxidase adjacent within the gene cluster generated four oxidised caryophyllene-based sesquiterpenes: 5Î²,6Î±,8Î²-trihydroxycariolan, 5Î²,8Î²-dihydroxycariolan along with two previously unknown caryophyllene derivatives 2 and 3. This represents the first steps towards heterologous production of such basidiomycete-derived caryophyllene-based sesquiterpenes, opening a venue for potential novel antimicrobials via combinatorial biosynthesis.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Matricaria recutita (German chamomile) and Chamaemelum nobile (Roman chamomile) belong to the botanical family Asteraceae. These two herbs are not only morphologically distinguishable, but their secondary metabolites - especially the essential oils present in flowers are also different, especially the terpenoids. The aim of this project was to preliminarily identify regulatory mechanisms in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathways that differ between German and Roman chamomile by performing comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. RESULTS:We determined the content of essential oils in disk florets and ray florets in these two chamomile species, and found that the terpenoid content in flowers of German chamomile is greater than that of Roman chamomile. In addition, a comparative RNA-seq analysis of German and Roman chamomile showed that 54% of genes shared &gt;â€‰75% sequence identity between the two species. In particular, more highly expressed DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and TF (transcription factor) genes, different regulation of CYPs (cytochrome P450 enzymes), and rapid evolution of downstream genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway of German chamomile could be the main reasons to explain the differences in the types and levels of terpenoid compounds in these two species. In addition, a phylogenetic tree constructed from single copy genes showed that German chamomile and Roman chamomile are closely related to Chrysanthemum nankingense. CONCLUSION:This work provides the first insights into terpenoid biosynthesis in two species of chamomile. The candidate unigenes related to terpenoid biosynthesis will be important in molecular breeding approaches to modulate the essential oil composition of Matricaria recutita and Chamaemelum nobile.">

In this review, we have summarized current progress in engineering yeast cell factories for production of natural products, including terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenylpropanoids. We then discuss advanced strategies in metabolic engineering at three different dimensions, including point, line, and plane (corresponding to the individual enzymes and cofactors, metabolic pathways, and the global cellular network). In particular, we comprehensively discuss how to engineer cofactor biosynthesis for enhancing the biosynthesis efficiency, other than the enzyme activity. Finally, current challenges and perspective are also discussed for future engineering direction.">

Orchids show a high level of variation in their floral morphologies, which makes them popular as ornamental plants in the global market. Floral scent and color are key traits for many floricultural crops. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play vital roles in pollinator attraction, defense, and interaction with the environment. Recent progress in omics technology has led to the isolation of genes encoding candidate enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis and regulatory circuits of plant VOCs. Uncovering the biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms underlying the production of floral scents is necessary not only for a better understanding of the function of relevant genes but also for the generation of new cultivars with desirable traits through molecular breeding approaches. However, little is known about the pathways responsible for floral scents in orchids because of their long life cycle as well as the complex and large genome; only partial terpenoid pathways have been reported in orchids. Here, we review the biosynthesis and regulation of floral volatile compounds in orchids. In particular, we focused on the genes responsible for volatile compounds in various tissues and developmental stages in Cymbidium orchids. We also described the emission of orchid floral volatiles and their function in pollination ecology. Taken together, this review will provide a broad scope for the study of orchid floral scents.">

However, limited information is available as to the HW formation of this species. The objective of this research is to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the HW formation process from specific Taiwania xylem tissues, and to obtain genes that might be closely associated with this process. The results indicated that our analyses have captured DEGs representative to the HW formation process of Taiwania. DEGs related to the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway were all up-regulated in the transition zone (TZ) to support the biosynthesis and accumulation of terpenoids. Many DEGs related to lignin biosynthesis, and two DEGs related to pinoresinol reductase (PrR)/pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase (PLR), were up-regulated in TZ. These DEGs together are likely involved in providing the precursors for the subsequent lignan biosynthesis. Several transcription factor-, nuclease-, and protease-encoding DEGs were also highly expressed in TZ, and these DEGs might be involved in the regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis and the autolysis of the cellular components of ray parenchyma cells in TZ. These results provide further insights into the process of HW formation in Taiwania.">

We have engineered a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, for production of squalene from CO2. In this organism, squalene is produced via the methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis, and consumed by the enzyme squalene hopene cyclase (Shc) for generation of hopanoids. The gene encoding Shc in Synechocystis was inactivated (Î”shc) by insertion of a gene encoding a squalene synthase from the green alga Botryococcus braunii, under control of an inducible promoter. We could demonstrate elevated squalene generation in cells where the algal enzyme was induced. Heterologous overexpression of genes upstream in the MEP pathway further enhanced the production of squalene, to a level three times higher than the Î”shc background strain.

However, a detailed study of these genes has not been undertaken due to the lack of a stable transformation system. We report for the first time an agroinfiltration system in hemp utilizing vacuum infiltration, which is an alternative method to stable transformation. A combination of 0.015% Silwett L-77, 5â€‰mM ascorbic acid, and thirty second sonication followed by a 10-minute vacuum treatment resulted in the highest Î²-glucuronidase expression in the leaf, male and female flowers, stem, and root tissues.

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Eremophila R.Br. (Scrophulariaceae) is a diverse genus of plants with species distributed across semi-arid and arid Australia. It is an ecologically important genus that also holds cultural significance for many Indigenous Australians who traditionally use several species as sources of medicines. Structurally unusual diterpenoids, particularly serrulatane and viscidane-types, feature prominently in the chemical profile of many species and recent studies indicate that these compounds are responsible for much of the reported bioactivity. We have investigated the biosynthesis of diterpenoids in three species: Eremophila lucida, Eremophila drummondii and Eremophila denticulata subsp. trisulcata. RESULTS:In all studied species diterpenoids were localised to the leaf surface and associated with the occurrence of glandular trichomes. Trichome-enriched transcriptome databases were generated and mined for candidate terpene synthases (TPS). Four TPSs with diterpene biosynthesis activity were identified: ElTPS31 and ElTPS3 from E. lucida were found to produce (3Z,7Z,11Z)-cembratrien-15-ol and 5-hydroxyviscidane, respectively, and EdTPS22 and EdtTPS4, from E. drummondii and E. denticulata subsp. trisulcata, respectively, were found to produce 8,9-dihydroserrulat-14-ene which readily aromatized to serrulat-14-ene. In all cases, the identified TPSs used the cisoid substrate, nerylneryl diphosphate (NNPP), to form the observed products. Subsequently, cis-prenyl transferases (CPTs) capable of making NNPP were identified in each species. CONCLUSIONS:We have elucidated two biosynthetic steps towards three of the major diterpene backbones found in this genus. Serrulatane and viscidane-type diterpenoids are promising candidates for new drug leads. The identification of an enzymatic route to their synthesis opens up the possibility of biotechnological production, making accessible a ready source of scaffolds for further modification and bioactivity testing.">

The metabolites from trichomes have been well characterized in tea products. However, little is known regarding the metabolites in fresh tea trichomes and the molecular differences in trichomes and tea leaves per se. In this study, we developed a method to collect trichomes from tea plant tender shoots, and their main secondary metabolites, including catechins, caffeine, amino acids, and aroma compounds, were determined. We found that the majority of these compounds were significantly less abundant in trichomes than in tea leaves. RNA-Seq was used to investigate the differences in the molecular regulatory mechanism between trichomes and leaves to gain further insight into the differences in trichomes and tea leaves. In total, 52.96 Gb of clean data were generated, and 6560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 4471 upregulated and 2089 downregulated genes, were identified in the trichomes vs. leaves comparison. Notably, the structural genes of the major metabolite biosynthesis pathways, transcription factors, and other key DEGs were identified and comparatively analyzed between trichomes and leaves, while trichome-specific genes were also identified. Our results provide new insights into the differences between tea trichomes and leaves at the metabolic and transcriptomic levels, and open up new doors to further recognize and re-evaluate the role of trichomes in tea quality formation and tea plant growth and development.">

These natural products include some of the most poisonous small molecules known and unique cyclic polyethers. However, the diversity and complexity of algal genomes means that sequencing-based research has lagged behind research into more readily sequenced microbes, such as bacteria and fungi. Applying informatics techniques to the algal genomes that are now available reveals new natural product biosynthetic pathways, with different groups of algae containing different types of pathways. There is some evidence for gene clusters and the biosynthetic logic of polyketides enables some prediction of these final products. For other pathways, it is much more challenging to predict the products and there may be many gene clusters that are not identified with the automated tools. These results suggest that there is a great diversity of biosynthetic capacity for natural products encoded in the genomes of algae and suggest areas for future research focus.">

What is worse, a successful plant virus evolves multiple strategies to manipulate host defenses to promote the population of the insect vector and thereby furthers the disease pandemic. Jasmonate (JA) and its derivatives (JAs) are lipid-based phytohormones with similar structures to animal prostaglandins, conferring plant defenses against various biotic and abiotic challenges, especially pathogens and herbivores. For survival, plant viruses and herbivores have evolved strategies to convergently target JA signaling. Here, we review the roles of JA signaling in the tripartite interactions among plant, virus, and insect vectors, with a focus on the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that drive vector-borne plant viral diseases. This knowledge is essential for the further design and development of effective strategies to protect viral damages, thereby increasing crop yield and food security.">

In normal condition, agarwood is naturally formed in &lt;i&gt;Aquilaria&lt;/i&gt; trees as a defense mechanism upon physical damage or microbial infection on the trees, which is a slow process that occurs over several years. The high demand in agarwood has spurred the development of various artificial inoculation methods where agarwood formation is synthetically induced in a shorter period of time. However, the synthetic induction method produces agarwood with aromas different from the naturally formed agarwood. To understand the changes in the agarwoods produced from different induction conditions, metabolite profiling of agarwood essential oil from &lt;i&gt;A. malaccensis&lt;/i&gt; has been performed. The essential oils of healthy undamaged tree trunks and, naturally formed and synthetically induced agarwoods were obtained using hydrodistillation (HS) method and analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS).

        <span class="abst" title="Acute and precise signal perception and transduction are essential for plant defense against insects. Insect elicitors-that is, the biologically active molecules from insects' oral secretion (which contains regurgitant and saliva), frass, ovipositional fluids, and the endosymbionts-are recognized by plants and subsequently induce a local or systematic defense response. On the other hand, insects secrete various types of effectors to interfere with plant defense at multiple levels for better adaptation. Jasmonate is a main regulator involved in plant defense against insects and integrates with multiple pathways to make up the intricate defense network. Jasmonate signaling is strictly regulated in plants to avoid the hypersensitive defense response and seems to be vulnerable to assault by insect effectors at the same time. Here, we summarize recently identified elicitors, effectors, and their target proteins in plants and discuss their underlying molecular mechanisms.">

Our olfactory senses were used in ancient medicine to diagnose diseases in patients. As humans are considered holobionts, each person's unique odor consists of volatile organic compounds (VOCs, volatilome) produced not only by the humans themselves but also by their beneficial and pathogenic micro-habitants. In the past decade it has been well documented that microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) are able to emit a broad range of olfactory active VOCs [summarized in the mVOC database (http://bioinformatics.charite.de/mvoc/)]. During microbial infection, the equilibrium between the human and its microbiome is altered, followed by a change in the volatilome. For several decades, physicians have been trying to utilize these changes in smell composition to develop fast and efficient diagnostic tools, particularly because volatiles detection is non-invasive and non-destructive, which would be a breakthrough in many therapies. Within this review, we discuss bacterial infections including gastrointestinal, respiratory or lung, and blood infections, focusing on the pathogens and their known corresponding volatile biomarkers. Furthermore, we cover the potential role of the human microbiota and their volatilome in certain diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases. We also report on discrete mVOCs that affect humans.">

However, for economic applications further development and implementation of efficient and sustainable cultivation strategies are essential. Here, we present a comparative study on cyanobacterial sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 using a commercial lab-scale High Density Cultivation (HDC) platform in the presence of dodecane as in-situ extractant. Operating in a two-step semi-batch mode over a period of eight days, volumetric yields of (E)-Î±-bisabolene were more than two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported for cyanobacteria, with final titers of 179.4â€‰Â±â€‰20.7â€‰mg * L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Likewise, yields of the sesquiterpene alcohols (-)-patchoulol and (-)-Î±-bisabolol were many times higher than under reference conditions, with final titers of 17.3â€‰Â±â€‰1.85â€‰mg * L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 96.3â€‰Â±â€‰2.2â€‰mg * L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. While specific productivity was compromised particularly for (E)-Î±-bisabolene in the HDC system during phases of high biomass accumulation rates, volumetric productivity enhancements during linear growth at high densities were more pronounced for (E)-Î±-bisabolene than for the hydroxylated terpenoids. Together, this study provides additional insights into cell density-related process characteristics, introducing HDC as highly efficient strategy for phototrophic terpenoid production in cyanobacteria.">

Here, 50 active compounds and 164 putative targets were collected and identified with 251 clinically tested AD-associated target proteins using network pharmacology approaches. Based on the Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichments, the compound-target-pathway-disease/protein-protein interaction network constructions, and the network topological analysis, we concluded that &lt;i&gt;A. oxyphylla&lt;/i&gt; may have neuroprotective effects by regulating neurotransmitter function, as well as brain plasticity in neuronal networks. Moreover, closely-related AD proteins, including the amyloid-beta precursor protein, the estrogen receptor 1, acetylcholinesterase, and nitric oxide synthase 2, were selected as the bottleneck nodes of network for further verification by molecular docking. Our analytical results demonstrated that terpene, as the main compound of &lt;i&gt;A. oxyphylla&lt;/i&gt; extract, exerts neuroprotective effects, providing new insights into the development of a natural therapy for the prevention and treatment of AD.">

In this review, we surveyed studies analyzing BVOCs and selected the most abundant 23 terpenes and terpenoids emitted in forested areas of the Northern Hemisphere, which were reported to display anti-inflammatory activities. We categorized anti-inflammatory processes related to the functions of these compounds into six groups and summarized their molecular mechanisms of action. Finally, among the major 23 compounds, we examined the therapeutic potentials of 12 compounds known to be effective against respiratory inflammation, atopic dermatitis, arthritis, and neuroinflammation among various inflammatory diseases. In conclusion, the updated studies support the beneficial effects of forest aerosols and propose their potential use as chemopreventive and therapeutic agents for treating various inflammatory diseases.">

Essentially to simplify studies, transmission has been considered for decades as an interaction between two partners, virus and vector. This interaction has gained a third partner, the host plant, to establish a tripartite pathosystem in which the players can react with each other directly or indirectly through changes induced in/by the third partner. For instance, viruses can alter the plant metabolism or plant immune defence pathways to modify vector's attraction, settling or feeding, in a way that can be conducive for virus propagation. Such changes in the plant physiology can also become favourable to the vector, establishing a mutualistic relationship. This review focuses on the recent molecular data on the interplay between viral and plant factors that provide some important clues to understand how viruses manipulate both the host plants and vectors in order to improve transmission conditions and thus ensuring their survival.">

However, in mangrove ecosystems there is no complete genome in this genus. In this study, we isolated a fungus strain named Penicillium variabile HXQ-H-1 from coast mangrove (Fujian Province, China). We generated a chromosome-level genome with total size of 33.32 Mb, scaffold N50 of 5.23 Mb and contig N50 of 96.74 kb. Additionally, we anchored about 95.91% assembly sequences into the longest seven scaffolds, and predicted 10,622 protein-coding genes, in which 99.66% could be annotated by eight protein databases. The secondary metabolites analysis reveals the strain has various gene clusters involving polyketide synthase (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and terpene synthase that may have a largely capacity of biotechnological potential. Comparison genome analysis between Penicillium variabile and Talaromyces islandicus reveals a small difference in the total number of genes, whereas HXQ-H-1 has a higher gene number with COG functional annotation. Evolutionary relationship of Penicillum based on genome-wide data was carried out for the first time, showing the strain HXQ-H-1 is closely related to Talaromyces islandicus. This genomic resource may provide a new resource for development of novel bioactive antibiotics, drug candidates and precursors in Penicillium variabile.">

Chia leaves contain plethora of secondary metabolites with medicinal properties. In this study, we sequenced chia leaf and root transcriptomes using the Illumina platform. The short reads were assembled into contigs using the Trinity software and annotated against the Uniprot database. The reads were de novo assembled into 103,367 contigs, which represented 92.8% transcriptome completeness and a diverse set of Gene Ontology terms. Differential expression analysis identified 6151 and 8116 contigs significantly upregulated in the leaf and root tissues, respectively. In addition, we identified 30 contigs belonging to the Terpene synthase (TPS) family and demonstrated their evolutionary relationships to tomato TPS family members. Finally, we characterized the expression of &lt;i&gt;S. hispanica&lt;/i&gt; TPS members in leaves subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments. Abscisic acid had the most pronounced effect on the expression of the TPS genes tested in this study. Our work provides valuable community resources for future studies aimed at improving and utilizing the beneficial constituents of this emerging healthy food source.">

To find novel antibiotic agents, researchers have turned to previously neglected and extreme environments. Here, we isolated a new strain, &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. S-2, for the first time, from black soot after hard coal combustion (collected from an in-use household chimney). We examined its antifungal properties against plant pathogens and against fungi that potentially pose threat to human health (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium avenaceum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/i&gt; and the environmental isolates &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; citrinoviridae Cin-9, &lt;i&gt;Nigrospora oryzae&lt;/i&gt; sp. roseF7, and &lt;i&gt;Curvularia coatesieae&lt;/i&gt; sp. junF9). Furthermore, we obtained the genome sequence of S-2 and examined its potential for secondary metabolites production using anti-SMASH software. The S-2 strain shows activity against all of the tested fungi. Genome mining elucidated a vast number of biosynthetic gene clusters (55), which distinguish this strain from closely related strains. The majority of the predicted clusters were assigned to non-ribosomal peptide synthetases or type 1 polyketide synthetases, groups known to produce compounds with antimicrobial activity. A high number of the gene clusters showed no, or low similarity to those in the database, raising the possibility that S-2 could be a producer of novel antibiotics. Future studies on &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. S-2 will elucidate its full biotechnological potential.">

Among the 82,053 homologous clusters obtained for Trametes, we identified 8518 core genes, 60,441 accessory genes, and 13,094 specific genes. A large proportion of CAZyme genes were cataloged into glycoside hydrolases, glycosyltransferases, and carbohydrate esterases. The predicted BGCs of Trametes were divided into six strategies, and the nine Trametes strains harbored 47.78 BGCs on average. Our study revealed that Trametes exhibits an open pan-genome structure.

However, the gene regulation pathways associated with monoterpene and paeoniflorin biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;P. lactiflora&lt;/i&gt; are still unclear.

We performed an RNA-sequencing experiment to profile the transcriptome changes of the shoots and roots. Using de novo assembly analysis, we identified 36,264 unigenes, including 521 genes responsible for encoding transcription factors. We also identified 28,925 unigenes that were differentially expressed in different organs and/or genotypes. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the &lt;i&gt;P. lactiflora&lt;/i&gt; unigenes were significantly overrepresented in several secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. We identified and profiled 33 genes responsible for encoding the enzymescontrolling the major catalytic reactions in the terpenoid backbone and in monoterpenoid biosynthesis.

Here we report the 32 Mb draft genome sequence of S. bambusicola S4201, encoding 11,332 predicted genes. The genome of S. bambusicola is enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) and pathogenesis-related genes. The phylogenetic tree of S. bambusicola S4201 and nine other sequenced species was constructed and its taxonomic status was supported (Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes). The genome contains a rich set of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, suggesting that strain S4201 has a remarkable capacity to produce secondary metabolites. Overexpression of the zinc finger transcription factor zftf, which is involved in hypocrellin A (HA) biosynthesis, increases HA production when compared with wild type. In addition, a new putative HA biosynthetic pathway is proposed. These results provide a framework to study the mechanisms of infection in bamboo and to understand the phylogenetic relationships of S. bambusicola S4201. At the same time, knowledge of the genome sequence may potentially solve the puzzle of HA biosynthesis and lead to the discovery of novel genes and secondary metabolites of importance in medicine and agriculture.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Clematis&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;florida&lt;/i&gt; is a popular ornamental vine species known for diverse colors and shapes of its flowers but not for scent. Here we investigated the composition and biosynthesis of floral scent in 'Kaiser', a fragrant cultivar of &lt;i&gt;C. florida&lt;/i&gt; that has sterile flowers. Volatile profiling revealed that flowers of 'Kaiser' emit more than 20 compounds, with monoterpenes being most abundant. Among the three floral organs, namely sepals, transformed-petals, and ovaries, ovaries had the highest rates of total volatile emission. To determine the molecular mechanism underlying floral scent biosynthesis in 'Kaiser', we sequenced a flower transcriptome and searched the transcriptome for terpene synthase genes (&lt;i&gt;TPSs&lt;/i&gt;), which are key genes for terpene biosynthesis. Among the &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes identified, three were putative intact full-length genes and were designated &lt;i&gt;CfTPS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CfTPS2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;CfTPS3&lt;/i&gt;. Phylogenetic analysis placed &lt;i&gt;CfTPS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CfTPS2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;CfTPS3&lt;/i&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;TPS-g&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;TPS-a&lt;/i&gt; subfamily, respectively. Through in vitro enzyme assays with &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;-expressed recombinant proteins, both &lt;i&gt;CfTPS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CfTPS2&lt;/i&gt; were demonstrated to catalyze the conversion of geranyl diphosphate to linalool, the most abundant constituent of &lt;i&gt;C. florida&lt;/i&gt; floral scent. In addition, &lt;i&gt;CfTPS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CfTPS2&lt;/i&gt; produced the sesquiterpene nerolidol from (&lt;i&gt;E,E&lt;/i&gt;)-farnesyl diphosphate. &lt;i&gt;CfTPS3&lt;/i&gt; showed sesquiterpene synthase activity and produced multiple products &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. All three &lt;i&gt;CfTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes showed higher levels of expression in sepals than those in transformed-petals and ovaries. Our results show that despite being sterile, the flowers of 'Kaiser' have normal mechanisms for floral scent biosynthesis that make the flowers fragrant.">

        <span class="abst" title="Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is an important economic plant because of the value of its essential oil (EO). The Yili Valley in Xinjiang has become the largest lavender planting base in China. However, there is a lack of research on the gene expression regulation of EO biosynthesis and metabolism in local varieties. Here, de novo transcriptome analysis of inflorescence of three development stages from initial flower bud to flowering stage 50% from two lavender cultivars with contrasting EO production revealed the dynamics of 100,177 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) in various stages of spike development within and across the cultivars. The lavender transcriptome contained 77 DETs with annotations related to terpenoid biosynthesis. The expression profiles of the 27 genes involved in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, 22 genes in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, 28 genes related to monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis during inflorescence development were comprehensively characterized, and possible links between the expression changes of genes and contents of EO constituents were explored. The upregulated genes were mainly concentrated in the MEP pathway, whileÂ most genes in the MVA pathway were downregulated during flower development, and cultivars with a higher EO content presented higher expression of genes in the MEP pathway, indicating that EOs were chiefly produced through the MEP pathway. Additionally, MYB transcription factors constituted the largest number of transcripts in all samples, suggesting their potential roles in regulating EO biosynthesis. The sequences and transcriptional patterns of the transcripts will be helpful for understanding the molecular basis of lavender terpene biosynthesis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Monoterpenoids are industrially important natural products with applications in the flavours, fragrances, fuels and pharmaceutical industries. Most monoterpenoids are produced by plants, but recently two bacterial monoterpene synthases have been identified, including a cineole synthase (bCinS). Unlike plant cineole synthases, bCinS is capable of producing nearly pure cineole from geranyl diphosphate in a complex cyclisation cascade that is tightly controlled. Here we have used a multidisciplinary approach to show that Asn305 controls water attack on the Î±-terpinyl cation and subsequent cyclisation and deprotonation of the Î±-terpineol intermediate, key steps in the cyclisation cascade which direct product formation towards cineole. Mutation of Asn305 results in variants that no longer produce Î±-terpineol or cineole. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that water coordination is disrupted in all variants tested. Quantum mechanics calculations indicate that Asn305 is most likely a (transient) proton acceptor for the final deprotonation step. Our synergistic approach gives unique insight into how a single residue, Asn305, tames the promiscuous chemistry of monoterpene synthase cyclisation cascades. It does this by tightly controlling the final steps in cineole formation catalysed by bCinS to form a single hydroxylated monoterpene product.">

        <span class="abst" title="Î±-Terpineol has been widely used in daily chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and flavor industries due to its pleasant odor with high economic value and pharmacological action. Our previous study showed that Penicillium digitatum DSM 62840 was an efficient biocatalyst for the transformation of limonene to Î±-terpineol. Thus, it was meaningful to explore the genome features and the gene expression differences of strain DSM 62840 during limonene biotransformation, and the detailed bioconversion pathways. In this study, the functional genes related to limonene bioconversion were investigated using genome and transcriptome sequences analysis. The results showed that the P. digitatum DSM 62840 genome was estimated to be 29.09 Mb and it encoded 9,086 protein-encoding genes. The most annotated genes were associated to some protein metabolism and energy metabolism functions. When the threshold for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was set at twofold ratio, a total of 4,128, and 4,148 DEGs were identified in P_L_12h (limonene-treated condition) compared with P_0h (blank) and P_12h (limonene-untreated blank), respectively. Among them, the expression levels of genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, energy metabolism and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were significantly altered during the biotransformation. And the reliability of these results was further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, we found that the enzyme participated in limonene biotransformation was inducible. This enzyme was located in the microsome, and it was inhibited by cytochrome P450 inhibitors. This indicated that the cytochrome P450 may be responsible for the limonene bioconversion. Several differentially expressed cytochrome P450 genes were further identified, such as PDIDSM_85260 and PDIDSM_67430, which were significantly up-regulated with limonene treatment. These genes may be responsible for converting limonene to Î±-terpineol. Totally, the genomic and transcriptomic data could provide valuable information in the discovery of related-genes which was involved in limonene biotransformation, pathogenicity of fungi, and investigation of metabolites and biological pathways of strain DSM 62840.">

While they have mostly been isolated from plants and fungi, the availability and analysis of bacterial genome sequence data indicates that bacteria also possess many putative terpene synthase genes. In this study, we further explore this potential for terpene synthase activity in bacteria. Twenty two potential class I terpene synthase genes (TSs) were selected to represent the full sequence diversity of bacterial synthase candidates and recombinantly expressed in E. coli. Terpene synthase activity was detected for 15 of these enzymes, and included mono-, sesqui- and diterpene synthase activities. A number of confirmed sesquiterpene synthases also exhibited promiscuous monoterpene synthase activity, suggesting that bacteria are potentially a richer source of monoterpene synthase activity then previously assumed. Several terpenoid products not previously detected in bacteria were identified, including aromandendrene, acora-3,7(14)-diene and longiborneol. Overall, we have identified promiscuous terpene synthases in bacteria and demonstrated that terpene synthases with substrate promiscuity are widely distributed in nature, forming a rich resource for engineering terpene biosynthetic pathways for biotechnology.">

        <span class="abst" title="Tanacetum cinerariifolium flowers synthesize six pyrethrins that function as effective insecticides. trans-Chrysanthemol is an early intermediate in the synthesis of the monoterpene moiety of pyrethrins. Previously, the pyrethrum enzyme chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (TcCDS) was shown to catalyze the formation of the prenyl diphosphate compound chrysanthemyl diphosphate (CPP) by condensing two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Later work also showed that with a low concentration of DMAPP, TcCDS can also remove the diphosphate group to give chrysanthemol. The removal of the phosphate groups from other prenyl diphosphates, such as DMAPP, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and geranyl diphosphate (GPP), was previously shown to occur in two steps. In those cases, the first phosphate group is removed by a member of the Nudix hydrolase protein family, and the second by other unidentified phosphatases. These previously characterized Nudix proteins involved in the hydrolysis of prenyl diphosphates were shown to be cytosolic. Here we report that a plastidic Nudix protein from pyrethrum, designated TcNudix1, has high specificity for CPP and can hydrolyze it to chrysanthemol monophosphate (CMP). TcNudix1 is expressed specifically in the trichomes of the ovaries, where chrysanthemol is produced. TcNudix1 expression patterns and pathway reconstitution experiments presented here implicate the TcNudix1 protein in the biosynthesis of chrysanthemol.">

        <span class="abst" title="The sesquiterpene Î²-caryophyllene is an ubiquitous component in many plants that has commercially been used as an aroma in cosmetics and perfumes. Recent studies have shown its potential use as a therapeutic agent and biofuel. Currently, Î²-caryophyllene is isolated from large amounts of plant material. Molecular farming based on the Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression system may be used for a more sustainable production of Î²-caryophyllene. In this study, a full-length cDNA of a new duplicated Î²-caryophyllene synthase from Artemisia annua (AaCPS1) was isolated and functionally characterized. In order to produce Î²-caryophyllene in vitro, the AaCPS1 was cloned into a plant viral-based vector pEAQ-HT. Subsequently, the plasmid was transferred into the Agrobacterium and agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. The AaCPS1 expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR at different time points after agroinfiltration. The highest level of transcripts was observed at 9 days post infiltration (dpi). The AaCPS1 protein was extracted from the leaves at 9 dpi and purified by cobalt-nitrilotriacetate (Co-NTA) affinity chromatography using histidine tag with a yield of 89 mg kg-1 fresh weight of leaves. The protein expression of AaCPS1 was also confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot analyses. AaCPS1 protein uses farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as a substrate to produce Î²-caryophyllene. Product identification and determination of the activity of purified AaCPS1 were done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS results revealed that the AaCPS1 produced maximum 26.5 Â± 1 mg of Î²-caryophyllene per kilogram fresh weight of leaves after assaying with FPP for 6 h. Using AaCPS1 as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that N. benthamiana can be considered as an expression system for production of plant proteins that catalyze the formation of valuable chemicals for industrial applications.">

They are perennial aerophytes or epiphytes of terrestrial orchids growing on cliffs and tree trunks covered with mosses in forests throughout the tropical and subtropical Asia and eastern Australia. The stem contains a variety of bioactive components, including polysaccharides and alkaloids, with strong antioxidant, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. Great attention has been drawn to the Dendrobium genus regarding its medicinal effectiveness, and the related researches have been accumulating rapidly in recent years. The bioactive components are mainly the intermediates or final products produced in specialized metabolite biosynthesis. Thus far, the activity, molecular structure, and composition of major medicinal ingredients have been partially elucidated, and the sequencing of several transcriptomes has been starting to shed new light on the biosynthesis regulation mechanism. This paper reviewed the advances of researches concerning the biosynthetic pathways of medicinal specialized metabolites from Dendrobium, especially the large number of related genes, with the hope of further promoting the development and utilization of those components and correspondingly protecting the Dendrobium resources in more effective ways.">

VviTPS gene regions were grouped to chromosomes, with the haplotig assemblies used to identify allelic variants. Functional predictions of the VviTPS subfamilies were performed using enzyme active site phylogenies resulting in the putative identification of the initial substrate and cyclization mechanism of VviTPS enzymes. Subsequent groupings into conserved catalytic mechanisms was coupled with an analysis of cultivar-specific gene duplications, resulting in the identification of conserved and unique VviTPS clusters. These findings are presented as a collection of interactive networks where any VviTPS of interest can be queried through BLAST, allowing for a rapid identification of VviTPS-subfamily, enzyme mechanism and degree of connectivity (i.e., extent of duplication). The comparative genomic analyses presented expands our understanding of the VviTPS family and provides numerous new gene models from three diploid genomes.">

In this study, a limonene production process was developed with metabolically engineered &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; at the bioreactor scale.

        <span class="abst" title="Amylostereum areolatum is the symbiotic fungus of the Eurasian woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, a globally invasive species. The mutualistic symbiont is associated with the woodwasp, assisting the damage process and providing nutrition for its insect partners. Colonization and growth of A. areolatum have essential impacts on the development and spread of S. noctilio, though the mechanism of interaction between the two has been poorly described. In this study, the first genome of this symbiotic fungus was sequenced, assembled, and annotated. The assembled A. areolatum genome was 57.5â€‰Mb (54.51% GC content) with 15,611 protein-coding genes. We identified 580 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), 661 genes associated with pathogen-host interactions, and 318 genes encoding transport proteins in total. The genome annotation revealed 10 terpene/phytoene synthases responsible for terpenoid biosynthesis, which could be classified into three clades. Terpene synthase gene clusters in clade II were conserved well across Russulales. In this cluster, genes encoding mevalonate kinase (MK), EGR12 (COG1557), and nonplant terpene cyclases (cd00687) were the known biosynthesis and regulatory genes. Genome sequence analysis of this fungus would prove the possibility of A. areolatum volatiles affecting the host selection of S. noctilio on a molecular basis. We further clarified that A. areolatum was a strict obligate symbiotic fungus. The wasps might protect the fungus before it was introduced into a suitable host substrate by oviposition, while the fungus would provide S. noctilio with a suitable environment and nutrients for the larval growth. These results would lay a foundation for our understanding of the mechanism of this entomogenous symbiosis.IMPORTANCE Sirex noctilio (F.), together with Amylostereum areolatum, a wood-decaying symbiotic fungus, causes severe damage to Pinus species worldwide. In China, it causes extensive death of Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica). There is an obligate dependency mutualism between the woodwasp and its fungus. Studies have suggested that the fungal growth rate affected the size of the wasps: larger adults emerged from sites with a higher fungus growth rate. This genome is the first reported genome sequence of a woodwasp symbiotic fungus. Genome sequence analysis of this fungus would prove the possibility of A. areolatum volatiles affecting the host selection of S. noctilio on a molecular basis. We further clarified that A. areolatum was a strict obligate symbiotic fungus and that it would provide S. noctilio with a suitable environment and with nutrients for the larval growth.

Furthermore, in the genomic era, in which the number of available genomes is increasing, genome mining joined to synthetic biology are offering a significant help in drug discovery. In the present review we discuss the importance of genome mining and synthetic biology approaches to identify new natural products, also underlining considering the possible advantages and disadvantages of this technique. Moreover, we debate the associated techniques that can be applied following to genome mining for validation of data. Finally, we review on the literature describing all novel natural drugs isolated from bacteria, fungi, and other living organisms, not only from the marine environment, by a genome-mining approach, focusing on the literature available in the last ten years.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Osmanthus fragrans&lt;/i&gt; is widely grown for the purpose of urban greening and the pleasant aroma emitted from its flowers. The floral scent is determined by several monoterpenoid volatiles, such as linalool and its oxides, which are a few of the most common volatiles and the main components of the essential oils in most sweet osmanthus cultivars. In addition, the relative contents of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-linalool oxide (furan) may affect the aromas and quality of the essential oils. MYB proteins represent the largest family of transcription factors in plants and participate in regulating secondary metabolites. Several &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-elements, especially AC-rich regions, are known to be bound by 2R-MYBs and could be found in the promoter of the enzyme genes in the terpenoid metabolic pathway. However, there has to date been no investigation into the 2R-MYB family genes involved in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;O. fragrans&lt;/i&gt;. Here, 243 non-redundant 2R-MYB proteins were grouped into 33 clusters based on the phylogeny and exon-intron distribution. These genes were unevenly distributed on 23 chromosomes. Ka/Ks analysis showed that the major mode of 2R-MYB gene evolution was purifying selection. Expression analysis indicated that 2R-MYB genes in &lt;i&gt;O. fragrans&lt;/i&gt; exhibited varied expression patterns. A total of 35 OfMYBs representing the highest per kilobase per million mapped reads in the flower were selected for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The correlation analysis between the expression level and the contents of fragrant compounds at different flowering stages suggested that &lt;i&gt;OfMYB19&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;20&lt;/i&gt; exhibited remarkably positive correlation with the accumulation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-linalool oxides. &lt;i&gt;OfMYB51&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;65&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;88&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;121&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;137&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;144&lt;/i&gt; showed significantly negative correlations with one or more linalool oxides. Characterization of these proteins revealed that OfMYB19 and OfMYB137 were localized in the nuclei, but did not show transcriptional activation in the yeast system, which suggested that they may be bound to other transcription factors to exert regulatory functions. These findings provide useful information for further functional investigation of the 2R-MYBs and offer a foundation for clarifying the 2R-MYB transcription factors involved in the molecular mechanism of the regulation of monoterpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;Osmanthus fragrans&lt;/i&gt;.">

Although fungi produce many specialised or secondary metabolites for defence and interacting with the surrounding environment, the repertoire of specialised metabolites (SM) within &lt;i&gt;Pyrenophora&lt;/i&gt; pathogenic species remains mostly uncharted. In this study, an in-depth comparative analysis of the &lt;i&gt;P. teres&lt;/i&gt; f. &lt;i&gt;teres&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P teres&lt;/i&gt; f. &lt;i&gt;maculata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. tritici-repentis&lt;/i&gt; potential to produce SMs, based on in silico predicted biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), was conducted using genome assemblies from PacBio DNA reads. Conservation of BGCs between the &lt;i&gt;Pyrenophora&lt;/i&gt; species included type I polyketide synthases, terpene synthases and the first reporting of a type III polyketide synthase in &lt;i&gt;P teres&lt;/i&gt; f. &lt;i&gt;maculata&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;P. teres&lt;/i&gt; isolates exhibited substantial expansion of non-ribosomal peptide synthases relative to &lt;i&gt;P. tritici-repentis&lt;/i&gt;, hallmarked by the presence of tailoring cis-acting nitrogen methyltransferase domains. &lt;i&gt;P. teres&lt;/i&gt; isolates also possessed unique non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)-indole and indole BGCs, while a &lt;i&gt;P. tritici-repentis&lt;/i&gt; phytotoxin BGC for triticone production was absent in &lt;i&gt;P. teres&lt;/i&gt;.

        <span class="abst" title="Roots provide anchorage and enable the absorption of water and micronutrients from the soil for plants. Besides these essential functions, roots are increasingly being recognized as an important organ for the production of diverse secondary metabolites. The goal of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and function of terpenoid secondary metabolites in roots of different cultivars of the popular ornamental plant &lt;i&gt;Chrysanthemum morifolium&lt;/i&gt; Ramat. Although &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium&lt;/i&gt; is known for rich production of secondary metabolites in its flower heads and leaves, the diversity of secondary metabolites in roots remains poorly characterized. In this study, 12 cultivars of &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium&lt;/i&gt; were selected for comparative analysis. From their roots, a total of 20 terpenoids were detected, including four monoterpenes, 15 sesquiterpenes, and one diterpene. The cultivar 'She Yang Hong Xin Ju' exhibited the highest concentration of total terpenoids at approximately 730 ÂµgÂ·g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; fresh weight. Most cultivars contained sesquiterpenes as the predominant terpenoids. Of them, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Î²-farnesene was detected in all cultivars. Based on their terpenoid composition, the 12 cultivars were planed into four groups. To gain insights into the function of root secondary metabolites, we performed bioassays to assess their effects on growth of three species of pathogenic fungi: &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Magnaporthe oryzae&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Verticillium dahliae&lt;/i&gt;. Significant variability in antifungal activity of the root extracts among different cultivars were observed. The cultivar 'Xiao Huang Ju' was the only cultivar that had significant inhibitory effects on all three species of fungi. Our study reveals the diversity of terpenoids in roots of &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium&lt;/i&gt; and their function as a chemical defense against fungi.">

        <span class="abst" title="Late blight caused by &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt;, is one of the most devastating diseases of potato, and was responsible for the death of millions of people during the Irish Potato Famine in the nineteenth century. &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt; is a heterothallic oomycete that typically requires two compatible types (mating types), A1 and A2, to complete sexual reproduction (i.e., oospore production). Oospores have critical effects on disease epidemiology because they serve as the primary inoculum in subsequent growing seasons. The sexual reproduction of &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt; species is regulated by Î± hormones. In previous studies, we proved that transformants in which selected histone deacetylase (&lt;i&gt;HDAC&lt;/i&gt;) genes are silenced exhibit abnormal hormone production. In the current study, we compared the transcriptomes of &lt;i&gt;HDAC&lt;/i&gt;-silenced and wild-type strains to explore the genes regulated by HDAC and the genes involved in sex hormone biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt; species. A total of 14,423 transcripts of unigenes were identified in the wild-type strain, the &lt;i&gt;HDAC&lt;/i&gt; family-silenced transformant (HDST), and the &lt;i&gt;HDAC7&lt;/i&gt;-silenced transformant (H7ST). After comparing the intergroup gene expression levels, 1,612 unigenes were identified as differentially expressed among these strains. The expression levels of 16 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The functional annotation of the DEGs by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses indicated that HDACs affect the expression of genes related to metabolic and biosynthetic processes, RNA processing, translation, ribosome biogenesis, cellular structural constituents, RNA binding, and protein binding. Moreover, HDAC7 specifically influences the transcription of genes associated with transport, methylation, mitochondria, organelle inner membranes, receptors and transporters, and hydrolase activities. We also identified 18 candidate genes related to Î± hormones biosynthesis, including a gene encoding the NF-Y transcription factor (&lt;i&gt;PITG_10861&lt;/i&gt;). The overexpression of &lt;i&gt;PITG_10861&lt;/i&gt; increased the production of hormone Î±2. The results of this study revealed &lt;i&gt;P. infestans&lt;/i&gt; genes affected by histone acetylation. The data presented herein provide useful inputs for future research on the epigenetic mechanisms and mating behaviors of &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt; species.">

        <span class="abst" title="ElsinoÃ« fawcettii, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, causes citrus scab on numerous citrus varieties around the world. Known pathotypes of E. fawcettii are based on host range; additionally, cryptic pathotypes have been reported and more novel pathotypes are thought to exist. E. fawcettii produces elsinochrome, a non-host selective toxin which contributes to virulence. However, the mechanisms involved in potential pathogen-host interactions occurring prior to the production of elsinochrome are unknown, yet the host-specificity observed among pathotypes suggests a reliance upon such mechanisms. In this study we have generated a whole genome sequencing project for E. fawcettii, producing an annotated draft assembly 26.01 Mb in size, with 10,080 predicted gene models and low (0.37%) coverage of transposable elements. A small proportion of the assembly showed evidence of AT-rich regions, potentially indicating genomic regions with increased plasticity. Using a variety of computational tools, we mined the E. fawcettii genome for potential virulence genes as candidates for future investigation. A total of 1,280 secreted proteins and 276 candidate effectors were predicted and compared to those of other necrotrophic (Botrytis cinerea, Parastagonospora nodorum, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Zymoseptoria tritici), hemibiotrophic (Leptosphaeria maculans, Magnaporthe oryzae, Rhynchosporium commune and Verticillium dahliae) and biotrophic (Ustilago maydis) plant pathogens. Genomic and proteomic features of known fungal effectors were analysed and used to guide the prioritisation of 120 candidate effectors of E. fawcettii. Additionally, 378 carbohydrate-active enzymes were predicted and analysed for likely secretion and sequence similarity with known virulence genes. Furthermore, secondary metabolite prediction indicated nine additional genes potentially involved in the elsinochrome biosynthesis gene cluster than previously described. A further 21 secondary metabolite clusters were predicted, some with similarity to known toxin producing gene clusters. The candidate virulence genes predicted in this study provide a comprehensive resource for future experimental investigation into the pathogenesis of E. fawcettii.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants produce a large variety of highly functionalized terpenoids. Functional groups such as partially unsaturated rings and carboxyl groups provide handles to use these compounds as feedstock for biobased commodity chemicals. For instance, methylperillate, a monoterpenoid found in Salvia dorisiana, may be used for this purpose, as it carries both an unsaturated ring and a methylated carboxyl group. The biosynthetic pathway of methylperillate in plants is still unclear. In this work, we identified glandular trichomes from S. dorisiana as the location of biosynthesis and storage of methylperillate. mRNA from purified trichomes was used to identify four genes that can encode the pathway from geranyl diphosphate towards methylperillate. This pathway includes a (-)-limonene synthase (SdLS), a limonene 7-hydroxylase (SdL7H, CYP71A76), and a perillyl alcohol dehydrogenase (SdPOHDH). We also identified a terpene acid methyltransferase, perillic acid O-methyltransferase (SdPAOMT), with homology to salicylic acid OMTs. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana of these four genes, in combination with a geranyl diphosphate synthase to boost precursor formation, resulted in production of methylperillate. This demonstrates the potential of these enzymes for metabolic engineering of a feedstock for biobased commodity chemicals.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Due to their ability to use the photon energy of sunlight to fix carbon dioxide into biomass, cyanobacteria are promising hosts for the sustainable production of terpenoids, also known as isoprenoids, a diverse class of natural products with potential as advanced biofuels and high-value chemicals. However, the cyanobacterial enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the terpene precursors needed to make more complicated terpenoids are poorly characterized. Here we show that the predicted type II prenyltransferase CrtE encoded by the model cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC 7002 is homodimeric and able to synthesize C20-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) from C5-isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and C5-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The crystal structure of CrtE solved to a resolution of 2.7 Ã… revealed a strong structural similarity to the large subunit of the heterodimeric geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase 1 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; with each subunit containing 14 helices. Using mutagenesis, we confirmed that the fourth and fifth amino acids (Met-87 and Ser-88) before the first conserved aspartate-rich motif (FARM) play important roles in controlling chain elongation. While the WT enzyme specifically produced GGPP, variants M87F and S88Y could only generate C15-farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), indicating that residues with large side chains obstruct product elongation. In contrast, replacement of M87 with the smaller Ala residue allowed the formation of the longer C25-geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate (GFPP) product. Overall, our results provide new structural and functional information on the cyanobacterial CrtE enzyme that could lead to the development of improved cyanobacterial platforms for terpenoid production.">

Due to their electrophilic reaction mechanism-which involves the formation of carbocations followed by hydride shifts and skeletal rearrangements-terpene synthases often produce complex mixtures of products. In the present study, we investigate amino acids that determine the product specificities of the maize terpene synthases TPS4 and TPS10. The enzymes showed 57% amino acid similarity and produced different mixtures of sesquiterpenes. Sequence comparisons and structure modeling revealed that out of the 43 amino acids forming the active site cavity, 17 differed between TPS4 and TPS10. While combined mutation of these 17 residues in TPS4 resulted in an enzyme with a product specificity similar to TPS10, the additional mutation of two amino acids next to the active site led to a nearly complete conversion of TPS4 into TPS10. These data demonstrate that the different product specificities of TPS4 and TPS10 are determined not only by amino acids forming the active site cavity, but also by neighboring residues that influence the conformation of active site amino acids.">

Two such genomic features, namely, (i) metabolic gene cluster and (ii) neo-functionalization of tandem gene duplications, represent key factors corresponding to the creation of metabolic diversity of plant specialized metabolism. So far, several terpenoid and alkaloid biosynthetic genes have been characterized with gene clusters in some plants. On the other hand, some modification genes involved in flavonoid and glucosinolate biosynthesis were found to arise via gene neo-functionalization. Although the occurrence of both types of metabolic evolution are different, the neighboring genes are generally regulated by the same or related regulation factors. Therefore, the translation-based approaches associated with genomics, and transcriptomics are able to be employed for functional genomics focusing on plant secondary metabolism. Here, we present a survey of the current understanding of neighboring genes involved in plant secondary metabolism. Additionally, a genomic overview of neighboring genes of four model plants and transcriptional co-expression network neighboring genes to detect metabolic gene clusters in Arabidopsis is provided. Finally, the insights functional genomics have provided concerning the evolution and mechanistic regulation of both the formation and operation of metabolic neighboring clusters is discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Dextrorotatory borneol (D-borneol), a cyclic monoterpene, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine as an efficient topical analgesic drug. Fresh leaves of &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum&lt;/i&gt; trees, e.g., &lt;i&gt;C. burmannii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. camphor&lt;/i&gt;, are the main sources from which D-borneol is extracted by steam distillation, yet with low yields. Insufficient supply of D-borneol has hampered its clinical use and production of patent remedies for a long time. Biological synthesis of D-borneol offers an additional approach; however, mechanisms of D-borneol biosynthesis remain mostly unresolved. Hence, it is important and necessary to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Comparative analysis on the gene expression patterns of different D-borneol production &lt;i&gt;C. burmannii&lt;/i&gt; samples facilitates elucidation on the underlying biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol. Herein, we collected three different chemotypes of &lt;i&gt;C. burmannii&lt;/i&gt;, which harbor different contents of D-borneol.A total of 100,218 unigenes with an N50 of 1,128 bp were assembled de novo using Trinity from a total of 21.21 Gb clean bases. We used BLASTx analysis against several public databases to annotate 45,485 unigenes (45.38%) to at least one database, among which 82 unigenes were assigned to terpenoid biosynthesis pathways by KEGG annotation. In addition, we defined 8,860 unigenes as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which 13 DEGs were associated with terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. One 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and two monoterpene synthase, designated as &lt;i&gt;CbDXS9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CbTPS2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CbTPS3&lt;/i&gt;, were up-regulated in the high-borneol group compared to the low-borneol and borneol-free groups, and might be vital to biosynthesis of D-borneol in &lt;i&gt;C. burmannii.&lt;/i&gt; In addition, we identified one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB candidate genes, which exhibited the same expression patterns as &lt;i&gt;CbTPS2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CbTPS3&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that these transcription factors might potentially regulate D-borneol biosynthesis. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to detect the actual expression level of those candidate genes related to the D-borneol biosynthesis pathway, and the result showed that the expression patterns of the candidate genes related to D-borneol biosynthesis were basically consistent with those revealed by transcriptome analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We used transcriptome sequencing to analyze three different chemotypes of &lt;i&gt;C. burmannii&lt;/i&gt;, identifying three candidate structural genes (one DXS, two monoterpene synthases) and seven potential transcription factor candidates (one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB) involved in D-borneol biosynthesis. These results provide new insight into our understanding of the production and accumulation of D-borneol in &lt;i&gt;C. burmannii&lt;/i&gt;.">

Plants respond to arthropod attack with the rearrangement of their transcriptome which lead to subsequent phenotypic changes in the plants' metabolome. Here, we analysed transcriptomic and metabolite responses of two cucumber (Cucumis sativus) genotypes to chelicerate spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) during the first 3 days of infestation. Genes associated with the metabolism of jasmonates, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids and L-phenylalanine were most strongly upregulated. Also, genes involved in the biosynthesis of precursors for indirect defence-related terpenoids were upregulated while those involved in the biosynthesis of direct defence-related cucurbitacin C were downregulated. Consistent with the observed transcriptional changes, terpenoid emission increased and cucurbitacin C content decreased during early spider-mite herbivory. To further study the regulatory network that underlies induced defence to spider mites, differentially expressed genes that encode transcription factors (TFs) were analysed. Correlation analysis of the expression of TF genes with metabolism-associated genes resulted in putative identification of regulators of herbivore-induced terpenoid, green-leaf volatiles and cucurbitacin biosynthesis. Our data provide a global image of the transcriptional changes in cucumber leaves in response to spider-mite herbivory and that of metabolites that are potentially involved in the regulation of induced direct and indirect defences against spider-mite herbivory.">

D. carota tissues produce an essential oil that is rich in volatile terpenes and plays a major role in carrot aroma and flavor. Although terpene composition represents a critical quality attribute of carrots, little is known about the biosynthesis of terpenes in this crop. Here, we functionally characterized 19 terpene synthase (TPS) genes in an orange carrot (genotype DH1) and compared tissue-specific expression profiles and in vitro products of their recombinant proteins with volatile terpene profiles from DH1 and four other colored carrot genotypes. In addition to the previously reported (E)-Î²-caryophyllene synthase (DcTPS01), we biochemically characterized several TPS proteins with direct correlations to major compounds of carrot flavor and aroma including germacreneÂ D (DcTPS7/11), Î³-terpinene (DcTPS30) and Î±-terpinolene (DcTPS03). Random forest analysis of volatiles from colored carrot cultivars identified nine terpenes that were clearly distinct among the cultivars and likely contribute to differences in sensory quality. Correlation of TPS gene expression and terpene metabolite profiles supported the function of DcTPS01 and DcTPS03 in these cultivars. Our findings provide a roadmap for future breeding efforts to enhance carrot flavor and aroma.">

        <span class="abst" title="Abietane diterpenoids (ADs), synthesized in the roots of different Salvia species, such as aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone, salvipisone, and ferruginol, have a variety of known biological activities. We have shown that aethiopinone has promising cytotoxic activity against several human tumor cell lines, including the breast adenocarcinoma MCF7, HeLa, epithelial carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma PC3, and human melanoma A375. The low content of these compounds in natural sources, and the limited possibility to synthesize them chemically at low cost, prompted us to optimize the production of abietane diterpenoids by targeting genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, from which they are derived. Here, we report our current and ongoing efforts to boost the metabolic flux towards this interesting class of compounds in Salvia sclarea hairy roots (HRs). Silencing the gene encoding the ent-copalyl-diphosphate synthase gene (entCPPS), acting at the lateral geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) competitive gibberellin route, enhanced the content of aethiopinone and other ADs in S.Â sclarea HRs, indicating indirectly that the GGPP pool is a metabolic constraint to the accumulation of ADs. This was confirmed by overexpressing the GGPPS gene (geranyl-geranyl diphosphate synthase) which triggered also a significant 8-fold increase of abietane diterpene content above the basal constitutive level, with a major boosting effect on aethiopinone accumulation in S. sclarea HRs. A significant accumulation of aethiopinone and other AD compounds was also achieved by overexpressing the CPPS gene (copalyl diphosphate synthase) pointing to this biosynthetic step as another potential metabolic target for optimizing the biosynthesis of this class of compounds. However, by co-expressing of GGPPS and CPPS genes, albeit significant, the increase of abietane diterpenoids was less effective than that obtained by overexpressing the two genes individually. Taken together, the results presented here add novel and instrumental knowledge to a rational design of a hairy root-based platform to yield reliable amounts of aethiopinone and other ADs for a deeper understanding of their molecular pharmacological targets and potential future commercialization.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Secondary metabolites as natural products from endophytic fungi are important sources of pharmaceuticals. However, there is currently little understanding of endophytic fungi at the omics levels about their potential in secondary metabolites. Calcarisporium arbuscula, an endophytic fungus from the fruit bodies of Russulaceae, produces a variety of secondary metabolites with anti-cancer, anti-nematode and antibiotic activities. A comprehensive survey of the genome and transcriptome of this endophytic fungus will help to understand its capacity to biosynthesize secondary metabolites and will lay the foundation for the development of this precious resource.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, we reported the high-quality genome sequence of C. arbuscula NRRL 3705 based on Single Molecule Real-Time sequencing technology. The genome of this fungus is over 45â€‰Mb in size, larger than other typical filamentous fungi, and comprises 10,001 predicted genes, encoding at least 762 secretory-proteins, 386 carbohydrate-active enzymes and 177 P450 enzymes. 398 virulence factors and 228 genes related to pathogen-host interactions were also predicted in this fungus. Moreover, 65 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters were revealed, including the gene cluster for the mycotoxin aurovertins. In addition, several gene clusters were predicted to produce mycotoxins, including aflatoxin, alternariol, destruxin, citrinin and isoflavipucine. Notably, two independent gene clusters were shown that are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of alternariol. Furthermore, RNA-Seq assays showed that only expression of the aurovertin gene cluster is much stronger than expression of the housekeeping genes under laboratory conditions, consistent with the observation that aurovertins are the predominant metabolites. Gene expression of the remaining 64 gene clusters for compound backbone biosynthesis was all lower than expression of the housekeeping genes, which partially explained poor production of other secondary metabolites in this fungus.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our omics data, along with bioinformatics analysis, indicated that C. arbuscula NRRL 3705 contains a large number of biosynthetic gene clusters and has a huge potential to produce a profound number of secondary metabolites. This work also provides the basis for development of endophytic fungi as a new resource of natural products with promising biological activities.">

        <span class="abst" title="Volatile compounds are considered to be essential for the flavor and aroma quality of grapes. Thidiazuron (TDZ) is a commonly used growth regulator in grape cultivation that stimulates larger berries and prevents fruit drop. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of TDZ on the production of aroma volatiles and to identify the key genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis pathways that are affected by this compound. Treatment with TDZ had a negative effect on the concentration of volatile compounds, especially on monoterpenes, which likely impacts the sensory characteristics of the fruit. The expression analysis of genes related to the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathways confirmed that treatment with TDZ negatively regulated the key genes &lt;i&gt;DXS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DXS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DXR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HDR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VvPNGer&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;VvPNlinNer1&lt;/i&gt;. Specifically, the expression levels of the aforementioned genes were down-regulated in almost all berry development stages in the TDZ-treated samples. The novel results from the present study can be used to aid in the development of food products which maintain the flavor quality and sensory characteristics of grape. Furthermore, these findings can provide the theoretical basis that can help to optimize the utilization of TDZ for the field production of grapes at a commercial scale.">

        <span class="abst" title="Isoprenoids comprise one of the most chemically diverse family of natural products with high commercial interest. The structural diversity of isoprenoids is mainly due to the modular activity of three distinct classes of enzymes, including prenyl diphosphate synthases, terpene synthases, and cytochrome P450s. The heterologous expression of these enzymes in microbial systems is suggested to be a promising sustainable way for the production of isoprenoids. Several limitations are associated with native enzymes, such as low stability, activity, and expression profiles. To address these challenges, protein engineering has been applied to improve the catalytic activity, selectivity, and substrate turnover of enzymes. In addition, the natural promiscuity and modular fashion of isoprenoid enzymes render them excellent targets for combinatorial studies and the production of new-to-nature metabolites. In this review, we discuss key individual and multienzyme level strategies for the successful implementation of enzyme engineering towards efficient microbial production of high-value isoprenoids. Challenges and future directions of protein engineering as a complementary strategy to metabolic engineering are likewise outlined.">

Jute (Corchorus sp.) is the second most important source of bast fiber. Our result has shown that exogenous GA can positively regulate jute height and related characteristics which mean increasing endogenous GA production will help to get a jute variety with improved characteristics. However, genes involved in jute GA biosynthesis have not been analyzed precisely.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Genome-wide analysis identified twenty-two candidate genes involved in jute GA biosynthesis pathway. Among them, four genes- CoCPS, CoKS, CoKO and CoKAO work in early steps. Seven CoGA20oxs, three CoGA3oxs, and eight GA2oxs genes work in the later steps. These genes were characterized through phylogenetic, motif, gene structure, and promoter region analysis along with chromosomal localization. Spatial gene expression analysis revealed that 11 GA oxidases were actively related to jute GA production and four of them were marked as key regulators based on their expression level. All the biosynthesis genes both early and later steps showed tissue specificity. GA oxidase genes were under feedback regulation whereas early steps genes were not subject to such regulation.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Enriched knowledge about jute GA biosynthesis pathway and genes will help to increase endogenous GA production in jute by changing the expression level of key regulator genes.

Spreng is an aromatic medicinal herb known for its therapeutic and nutritional properties attributed by the presence of monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds. Up until now, research on terpenoid biosynthesis has focused on a few mint species with economic importance such as thyme and oregano, yet the terpene synthases responsible for monoterpene production in P. amboinicus have not been described. Here we report the isolation, heterologous expression and functional characterization of a terpene synthase involved in P. amboinicus terpenoid biosynthesis. A putative monoterpene synthase gene (PamTps1) from P. amboinicus was isolated with an open reading frame of 1797 bp encoding a predicted protein of 598 amino acids with molecular weight of 69.6 kDa. PamTps1 shares 60-70% amino acid sequence similarity with other known terpene synthases of Lamiaceae. The in vitro enzymatic activity of PamTps1 demonstrated the conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate exclusively into linalool and nerolidol, respectively, and thus PamTps1 was classified as a linalool/nerolidol synthase. In vivo activity of PamTps1 in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain revealed production of linalool and nerolidol which correlated with its in vitro activity. This outcome validated the multi-substrate usage of this enzyme in producing linalool and nerolidol both in in vivo and in vitro systems. The transcript level of PamTps1 was prominent in the leaf during daytime as compared to the stem. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that maximal linalool level was released during the daytime and lower at night following a diurnal circadian pattern which correlated with the PamTps1 expression pattern. The PamTps1 cloned herein provides a molecular basis for the terpenoid biosynthesis in this local herb that could be exploited for valuable production using metabolic engineering in both microbial and plant systems.">

We here summarize the recent advances on harnessing sub-organelle for isoprenoids biosynthesis in yeast, and analyze the knowledge about the localization of enzymes, cofactors and metabolites for guiding the rewiring of the sub-organelle metabolism.

        <span class="abst" title="The phytohormone Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic stresses, including senescence, seed germination, cold stress and drought. Several kinds of researches indicate that exogenous ABA can enhance artemisinin content in &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt;. Some transcription factors related to ABA signaling are identified to increase artemisinin accumulation through activating the artemisinin synthase genes. However, no prior study on ABA transporter has been performed in &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we identified a pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporter gene &lt;i&gt;AaPDR4/AaABCG40&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;AaABCG40&lt;/i&gt; was expressed mainly in roots, leaves, buds, and trichomes. GUS activity is primarily observed in roots and the vascular tissues of young leaves in &lt;i&gt;proAaABCG40&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;GUS&lt;/i&gt; transgenic &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt; plants. When &lt;i&gt;AaABCG40&lt;/i&gt; was transferred into yeast AD12345678, yeasts expressing &lt;i&gt;AaABCG40&lt;/i&gt; accumulated more ABA than the control. The &lt;i&gt;AaABCG40&lt;/i&gt; overexpressing plants showed higher artemisinin content and stronger drought tolerance. Besides, the expression of &lt;i&gt;CYP71AV1&lt;/i&gt; in OE-&lt;i&gt;AaABCG40&lt;/i&gt; plants showed more sensitivity to exogenous ABA than that in both wild-type and i&lt;i&gt;AaABCG40&lt;/i&gt; plants. According to these results, they strongly suggest that AaABCG40 is involved in ABA transport in &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt;.">

Also, significant progresses have been made in genome sequencing, multi-omic analysis and genome-scale modeling, thus illuminating the molecular basis behind its physiology, metabolism and response to environmental stresses. At the same time, genetic parts and tools are continuously being developed to manipulate this distinctive organism. Engineered R. toruloides strains are emerging for enhanced production of conventional lipids, functional lipids as well as other interesting metabolites.

In order to help delineate the biosynthetic pathways of various secondary metabolites, we report in this study a high-quality reference genome for &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt;. With the help of both PacBio single molecule real time sequencing and Illumina sequencing reads for error correction, the &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt; genome was assembled into a total size of 284 Mb with a contig N50 size of 5.14 Mb.

Here we investigated genetic variability in induced responses to stemborer egg-laying in maize Zea mays (L.) (Poaceae). We conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 146 maize genotypes comprising of landraces, inbred lines and commercial hybrids. Plants were phenotyped in bioassays measuring parasitic wasp Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) attraction to volatiles collected from plants exposed to stemborer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) eggs. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to generate maize germplasm SNP data for GWAS. The egg-induced parasitoid attraction trait was more common in landraces than in improved inbred lines and hybrids. GWAS identified 101 marker-trait associations (MTAs), some of which were adjacent to genes involved in the JA-defence pathway (opr7, aos1, 2, 3), terpene biosynthesis (fps3, tps2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10), benzoxazinone synthesis (bx7, 9) and known resistance genes (e.g. maize insect resistance 1, mir1). Intriguingly, there was also association with a transmembrane protein kinase that may function as a receptor for the egg elicitor and other genes implicated in early plant defence signalling. We report maize genomic regions associated with indirect defence and provide a valuable resource for future studies of tritrophic interactions in maize. The markers identified may facilitate selection of indirect defence by maize breeders.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ischemic heart disease (IHD), a major global public health problem, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although the very best of modern approaches have proven effective in reducing morbidity and mortality, the poor prognosis of patients with IHD remains a major clinical concern. Cardiac energy metabolism is increasingly recognized as having a role in the pathogenesis of IHD, inducing metabolic substrate alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and deprivation of cardiac energy. Factors involved in cardiac energy metabolism provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of IHD. Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have a long history of use in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases with multi-component, multi-target, and multi-signaling. Increasing evidence suggests that Chinese herbal medicines may improve myocardial ischemia through modulating cardiac energy metabolism. Here, we describe the possible targets and pathways of cardiac energy metabolism for CHMs, and appraise the modulatory effects of CHMs on energy metabolism in IHD. Especially, this review focuses on summarizing the metabolic effects and the underlying mechanisms of Chinese herbal medicines (including herbs, major bioactive components, and formulas) in IHD. In addition, we also discuss the current limitations and the major challenges for research investigating the use of CHMs in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.">

The safety concerns associated with the daily consumption of &lt;i&gt;Cordyceps&lt;/i&gt; fungi or related products are still being debated. On the one hand, the known compounds from these fungi such as adenosine analogs cordycepin and pentostatin have demonstrated different beneficial or pharmaceutical activities but also dose-dependent cytotoxicities, neurological toxicities and or toxicological effects in humans and animals. On the other hand, the possibility of mycotoxin production by &lt;i&gt;Cordyceps&lt;/i&gt; fungi has not been completely ruled out. In contrast to a few metabolites identified, an array of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are encoded in each genome of these fungi with the potential to produce a plethora of as yet unknown secondary metabolites. Conservation analysis of BGCs suggests that mycotoxin analogs of PR-toxin and trichothecenes might be produced by &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ordyceps&lt;/i&gt; fungi. Future elucidation of the compounds produced by these functionally unknown BGCs, and in-depth assessments of metabolite bioactivity and chemical safety, will not only facilitate the safe use of &lt;i&gt;Cordyceps&lt;/i&gt; fungi as human food or alternative medicine, but will also benefit the use of mass production byproducts as animal feed. To corroborate the long record of use as a traditional medicine, future efforts will also benefit the exploration of &lt;i&gt;Cordyceps&lt;/i&gt; fungi for pharmaceutical purposes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Wintersweet (&lt;i&gt;Chimonanthus praecox&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an ornamental and economically significant shrub known for its unique flowering characteristics, especially the emission of abundant floral volatile organic compounds. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the production of these compounds is necessary to create new breeds with high volatile production. In this study, two &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; transcription factors (&lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt;) of Wintersweet H29 were functionally characterized to illustrate their possible role in the production of volatile compounds. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt; increased from the flower budding to full bloom stage, indicating that these two genes may play an essential role in blooming and aroma production in wintersweet. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the overexpression of &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; in arabidopsis (&lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;AtMYC2-2&lt;/i&gt; mutant (Salk_083483) and tobacco (&lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabaccum&lt;/i&gt;) genotype Petit Havana SR1 significantly increased floral volatile monoterpene, especially linalool, while the overexpression of &lt;i&gt;CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) and tobacco genotype SR1 increased floral sesquiterpene Î²-caryophyllene production in both types of transgenic plants respectively. High expression of terpene synthase (TPS) genes in transgenic &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt; along with high expression of &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt; in transgenic plants was also observed. The application of a combination of methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) showed an increment in linalool production in &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt;-overexpressing arabidopsis plants, and the high transcript level of TPS genes also suggested the involvement of &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; in the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. These results indicate that both the &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt; transcription factors of wintersweet are possibly involved in the positive regulation and biosynthesis of monoterpene (linalool) and sesquiterpene (Î²-caryophyllene) in transgenic plants. This study also indicates the potential application of wintersweet as a valuable genomic material for the genetic modification of floral scent in other flowering plants that produce less volatile compounds.">

Although diverse tailoring enzymes are found to be clustered with cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs) to perform further modification reactions on the diketopiperazine (DKP) rings generating complex DKP-containing compounds, so far, a limited number of methyltransferases (MTs) co-occurring with CDPS have been experimentally characterized. Herein, we deciphered the methylation steps during drimentines (DMTs) biosynthesis with identification and characterization of DmtMT2-1 (from Streptomyces sp. NRRL F-5123) and DmtMT1 (from Streptomyces youssoufiensis OUC6819). DmtMT2-1 catalyzes N4-methylation of both pre-DMTs and DMTs; conversely, DmtMT1 recognizes the DKP rings, functioning before the assembly of the terpene moiety. Notably, both MTs display broad substrate promiscuity. Their combinatorial expression with the dmt1 genes in different Streptomyces strains successfully generated eight unnatural DMT analogs. Our results enriched the MT tool-box, setting the stage for exploring the structural diversity of DKP derivatives for drug development.">

This approach guided us to develop an efficient &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; production of five bioactive non- and monohydroxylated cembranoids.

        <span class="abst" title="The strain B-4, isolated from a field in Changsha (China), presents strong antifungal activities, as identified by the Kirby-Bauer test, especially for pathogens that harm crops. Here, we obtained the complete genome sequence of the strain B-4 by Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing, making it well analyzed for understanding mechanisms and creating biological agents. Its 3,919-kb circular chromosome genome has 3,725 protein-coding genes [coding sequences (CDSs)] and 46.7% guanine-cytosine content. A comparative genome analysis of B-4 with other published strains (including &lt;i&gt;Bacillus velezensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus amyloliquefaciens&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;) revealed that the strain B-4 is a &lt;i&gt;B. velezensis&lt;/i&gt; strain. These different strains have 2,889 CDSs in common, whereas 179 CDSs were found to be unique in the strain B-4, which is a far greater number than that in other strains. Regarding the antifungal activities of B-4, we were specifically concerned with the genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In total, more than 19.56% of the genome was annotated to 12 gene clusters relating to synthesis of antimicrobial metabolites, which contained various enzyme-encoding operons for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, polyketide synthases, and lantipeptide synthesis proteins. They were all considered to be related to the production of bacteriostatic substances or stimulation of induced systemic resistance by bacterial metabolites. These situations also present an advantage over those of other strains for biocontrol potential. We provide evidence that the biological control effect of the strain B-4, as demonstrated in antibacterial activity experiments and predicted from the complete genome sequence analysis, provides the basis for research promoting agricultural research on sustainable development, especially the contribution of biotechnology to agriculture.">

In this study, we evaluated viral effects on secondary metabolism of the rice blast fungus &lt;i&gt;Magnaporthe oryzae&lt;/i&gt; using an isolate of APU10-199A co-infected with three types of mycoviruses: a totivirus, a chrysovirus, and a partitivirus. Comparison of the secondary metabolite profile of APU10-199A with that of the strain lacking the totivirus and chrysovirus showed that a mycotoxin tenuazonic (TeA) acid was produced in a manner dependent on the mycoviruses. Virus reinfection experiments verified that TeA production was dependent on the totivirus. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and RNA-sequencing analysis indicated the regulatory mechanism underlying viral induction of TeA: the totivirus activates the TeA synthetase gene &lt;i&gt;TAS1&lt;/i&gt; by upregulating the transcription of the gene encoding a Zn(II)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cys&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-type transcription factor, &lt;i&gt;TAS2&lt;/i&gt;. To our knowledge, this is the first report that confirmed mycovirus-associated regulation of secondary metabolism at a transcriptional level by viral reinfection. Because only treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide has been reported to trigger TeA production in this fungus without gene manipulation, our finding highlights the potential of mycoviruses as an epigenomic regulator of fungal secondary metabolism.">

This divergence is often attributed to pathogen virulence factors, namely carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), secondary metabolites (SM), and small-secreted protein (SSP) effectors. The draft genome assembly and functional annotation of potential pathogenicity genes of both species obtained here provide an important and timely genomic resource for better understanding the biology and lifestyle of Colletotrichum spp. This should pave the way for designing more efficient disease control strategies in plantations of rubber tree. In this study, the genes associated with these categories were manually annotated in the genomes of C. australisinense GX1655 and C. siamense HBCG01. Comparative genomic analyses were performed to address the evolutionary relationships among these gene families in the two species. First, the size of genome assembly, number of predicted genes, and some of the functional categories differed significantly between the two congeners. Second, from the comparative genomic analyses, we identified some specific genes, certain higher abundance of gene families associated with CAZymes, CYP450, and SM in the genome of C. siamense, and Nep1-like proteins (NLP) in the genome of C. australisinense.">

However, cytotoxicity remains a challenge for triterpenoid overproduction in microbial cell factories. As lipophilic and relatively small molecular compounds, triterpenes are generally secreted into the extracellular space. The effect of increasing triterpene efflux on the synthesis capacity remains unknown.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, we developed a strategy to enhance triterpene efflux through manipulation of lipid components in &lt;i&gt;Y. lipolytica&lt;/i&gt; by overexpressing the enzyme Î”9-fatty acid desaturase (&lt;i&gt;OLE1&lt;/i&gt;) and disturbing phosphatidic acid phosphatase (&lt;i&gt;PAH1&lt;/i&gt;) and diacylglycerol kinase (&lt;i&gt;DGK1&lt;/i&gt;). By this strategy combined with two-phase fermentation, the highest lupeol production reported to date was achieved, where the titer in the organic phase reached 381.67Â mg/L and the total production was 411.72Â mg/L in shake flasks, exhibiting a 33.20-fold improvement over the initial strain. Lipid manipulation led to a twofold increase in the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content, up to 61-73%, and an exceptionally elongated cell morphology, which might have been caused by enhanced membrane phospholipid biosynthesis flux. Both phenotypes accelerated the export of toxic products to the extracellular space and ultimately stimulated the capacity for triterpenoid synthesis, which was proven by the 5.11-fold higher ratio of extra/intracellular lupeol concentrations, 2.79-fold higher biomass accumulation and 2.56-fold higher lupeol productivity per unit OD in the modified strains. This strategy was also highly efficient for the biosynthesis of other triterpenes and sesquiterpenes, including Î±-amyrin, Î²-amyrin, longifolene, longipinene and longicyclene.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;In conclusion, we successfully created a high-yield lupeol-producing strain via lipid manipulation. We demonstrated that the enhancement of lupeol efflux and synthesis capacity was induced by the increased UFA content and elongated cell morphology. Our study provides a novel strategy to promote the biosynthesis of valuable but toxic products in microbial cell factories.">

        <span class="abst" title="Stem rot, a devastating fungal disease of peanut, is caused by Sclerotium rolfsii. RNA-sequencing approaches have been used to unravel the mechanisms of resistance to stem rot in peanut over the course of fungal infection in resistant (NRCG-CS85) and susceptible (TG37A) genotypes under control conditions and during the course of infection. Out of about 290 million reads, nearly 251 million (92.22%) high-quality reads were obtained and aligned to the Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaensis genomes with the average mapping of 78.91% and 78.61%, respectively. In total, about 48.6% of genes were commonly regulated, while approximately 21.8% and 29.6% of uniquely regulated genes from A. duranensis and A. ipaensis genomes, respectively, were identified. Several annotated transcripts, such as receptor-like kinases, jasmonic acid pathway enzymes, and transcription factors (TFs), including WRKY, Zinc finger protein, and C2-H2 zinc finger, showed higher expression in resistant genotypes upon infection. These transcripts have a known role in channelizing the downstream of pathogen perception. The higher expression of WRKY transcripts might have induced the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) by the activation of the jasmonic acid defense signaling pathway. Furthermore, a set of 30 transcripts involved in the defense mechanisms were validated with quantitative real-time PCR. This study suggested PAMP-triggered immunity as a probable mechanism of resistance, while the jasmonic acid signaling pathway was identified as a possible defense mechanism in peanut. The information generated is of immense importance in developing more effective ways to combat the stem rot disease in peanut.">

Other species, particularly those originating from marine sources, are less studied. The aim of the study is to select promising strains with antimicrobial potential by combining genomic and phenotypic approaches on large datasets comprising 12 &lt;i&gt;Carnobacterium&lt;/i&gt; species. The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGCs) diversity of 39 publicly available &lt;i&gt;Carnobacterium&lt;/i&gt; spp. genomes revealed 67 BGCs, distributed according to the species and ecological niches. From zero to six BGCs were predicted per strain and classified into four classes: terpene, NRPS (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase), NRPS-PKS (hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase), RiPP (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide). In parallel, the antimicrobial activity of 260 strains from seafood products was evaluated. Among the 60% of active strains, three genomes were sequenced and submitted to a dereplication process. &lt;i&gt;C. inhibens&lt;/i&gt; MIP2551 produced a high amountof H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, probably thanks to the presence of four oxidase-encoding genes. &lt;i&gt;C. maltaromaticum&lt;/i&gt; EBP3019 and SF668 strains were highly efficient against &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. A new extracellular 16 kDa unmodified bacteriocin in the EBP3019 strain and five different bacteriocins in SF668 were highlighted. In this study, the overview of antimicrobial BGC and inhibitory activities of &lt;i&gt;Carnobacterium&lt;/i&gt; spp. allowed the prediction of potential innovative natural products that could be relevant for biotechnological applications.">

This work aims at evaluating the concomitant effects of different inorganic and organic fertilization treatments and the subsequent increases in soil nutrient availability on terpenoids and other carbon-based secondary metabolites, e.g., flavonoids and phenolic compounds, in Rosmarinus officinalis leaves. The results showed that, as expected, the structural carbohydrate content (lignocellulosic compounds) in stems was higher in fertilized plants than in controls. Additionally, positive correlations were observed of the absolute amounts of total terpenoids and some single terpenoid compounds with N or P contents in leaves. On the contrary, the phenolic and flavonoid concentrations in all the rosemary plant parts were lower with the fertilization treatments. Indeed, negative correlations between the phenolic compounds (and flavonoids) and N in rosemary leaves were also found. Overall, the results suggest that the terpenoid production's response to fertilization was due to N, which is essential for protein synthesis and terpene synthase activity, and to P, which is necessary for the synthesis of both terpenoid precursors and ATP and NADPH, also needed for terpenoid synthesis. On the other hand, the basis for the fertilization's effects on the production of phenolic compounds is the direct nitrogen trade-off between growth and the shikimic acid pathway by which phenolics compounds are synthesized.">

Many studies have verified that ginkgolides have anti-platelet-activating, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, neurotrophic, and neuroimmunomodulatory effects. Inflammatory immunomodulation is mediated by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathways. They also inhibit the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-mediated signal transduction to attenuate the inflammatory response.

In nature, terpene cyclases comprise the foundation of molecular biodiversity as they generate diverse hydrocarbon scaffolds found in thousands of terpenoid natural products. Here, we report that the catalytic activity of the terpene cyclases AaTPS and FgGS can be switched from cyclase to aromatic prenyltransferase at basic pH to generate prenylindoles. The crystal structures of AaTPS and FgGS provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of this cryptic function. Moreover, aromatic prenyltransferase activity discovered in other terpene cyclases indicates that this cryptic function is broadly conserved among the greater family of terpene cyclases. We suggest that this cryptic function is chemoprotective for the cell by regulating isoprenoid diphosphate concentrations so that they are maintained below toxic thresholds.">

The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes. The reconstruction and characterization of clade ancestors demonstrated that the differences among clades I-III were already present in their ancestors. However, the ancestors generally catalyzed simpler reactions with less double-bond isomerization and fewer cyclization steps. Overall, our data indicate an early origin of key enzymatic features of TPS-a enzymes in the Poaceae, and the development of more complex reactions over the course of evolution.">

The best achieved VRD-loaded ethosomes (ETH9) were optimized to invasomes via incorporation of terpenes (limonene, cineole and a 1:1 mixture) at three concentrations (0.5%, 1% and 2%, v/v). All systems were evaluated for vesicle size, zeta potential, drug entrapment efficiency (EE%), cumulative drug permeated percentages after 0.5hrs (Q&lt;sub&gt;0.5h&lt;/sub&gt;) and 12hrs (Q&lt;sub&gt;12h&lt;/sub&gt;) and steady-state flux (J&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;). The optimized system (ETH9-INV8) was further characterized for morphology, histopathology and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox), an important ornamental plant, has evolved unique fragrant aroma and winter-flowering properties, which are critical for its successful sexual reproduction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits are largely unknown in this species. In addition, wintersweet is also a typical representative species of the magnoliids, where the phylogenetic position of which relative to eudicots and monocots has not been conclusively resolved. RESULTS:Here, we present a chromosome-level wintersweet genome assembly with a total size of 695.36â€‰Mb and a draft genome assembly of Calycanthus chinensis. Phylogenetic analyses of 17 representative angiosperm genomes suggest that Magnoliids and eudicots are sister to monocots. Whole-genome duplication signatures reveal two major duplication events in the evolutionary history of the wintersweet genome, with an ancient one shared by Laurales, and a more recent one shared by the Calycantaceae. Whole-genome duplication and tandem duplication events have significant impacts on copy numbers of genes related to terpene and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (the main floral scent volatiles) biosynthesis, which may contribute to the characteristic aroma formation. An integrative analysis combining cytology with genomic and transcriptomic data reveals biological characteristics of wintersweet, such as floral transition in spring, floral organ specification, low temperature-mediated floral bud break, early blooming in winter, and strong cold tolerance. CONCLUSIONS:These findings provide insights into the evolutionary history of wintersweet and the relationships among the Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots; the molecular basis underlying floral scent biosynthesis; and winter flowering, and highlight the utility of multi-omics data in deciphering important ornamental traits in wintersweet.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Triterpenoids from birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.) exert antitumor and anti-HIV activities. Due to the complexity of plant secondary metabolic pathways, triterpene compounds in plants is not always determined by a single gene; they may be controlled by polygene quantitative traits. Secondary metabolism related to terpenoids involves tissue specificity and localisation of key biosynthetic enzymes. Terpene synthesis is influenced by light, hormones and other signals, as well as upstream transcription factor regulation.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Anchor Herein, we identified and characterised two birch MYB transcription factors (TFs) that regulate triterpenoid biosynthesis. BpMYB21 and BpMYB61 are R2R3 TFs that positively and negatively regulate responses to methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) and salicyclic acid (SA), respectively. Expression of BpMYB21 and BpMYB61 was elevated in leaves and stems more than roots during July/August in Harbin, China. BpMYB21 expression was increased by abscisic acid (ABA), MeJA, SA and gibberellins (GAs). BpMYB61 expression in leaves and BpMYB21 expression in stems was reduced by ABA, MeJA and SA, while GAs, ethylene, and injury increased BpMYB61 expression. BpMYB21 was localised in nuclei, while BpMYB61 was detected in cell membranes and nuclei. Promoters for both BpMYB21 (1302â€‰bp) and BpMYB61 (850â€‰bp) were active. BpMYB21 and BpMYB61 were ligated into pYES3, introduced into AnchorINVScl (yeast strain without exogenous genes), INVScl-pYES2-SSAnchorAnchor (transgenic yeast strain harbouring the SS gene from birch), and INVScl-pYES2-SE (transgenic yeast strain harbouring the SE gene from birch), and the squalene content was highest in AnchorINVScl-pYES-MYB21-SS (transgenic yeast strain harbouring SS and MYB21 genes) and INVScl-pYES3-MYB61 (transgenic yeast strain harbouring the MYB61 gene). In BpMYB21 transgenic birch key triterpenoid synthesis genes were up-regulated, and in BpMYB61 transgenic birch AnchorFPS (farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase) and SS (squalene synthase) were up-regulated, but HMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase), BPWAnchor (lupeol synthase), SE (squalene epoxidase) and BPY (b-amyrin synthase) were down-regulated. Both BpMYB21 and BpMYB61 specifically activate SE and BPX (cycloartenol synthase synthesis) promoters.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;These findings support further functional characterisation of R2R3-MYB genes, and illuminate the regulatory role of BpMYB21 and BpMYB61 in the synthesis of birch triterpenoids.">

        <span class="abst" title="Analysis of the updated reference tomato genome found 34 full-length TPS genes and 18 TPS pseudogenes. Biochemical analysis has now identified the catalytic activities of all enzymes encoded by the 34 TPS genes: one isoprene synthase, 10 exclusively or predominantly monoterpene synthases, 17 sesquiterpene synthases and six diterpene synthases. Among the monoterpene and sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases, some use trans-prenyl diphosphates, some use cis-prenyl diphosphates and some use both. The isoprene synthase is cytosolic; six monoterpene synthases are plastidic, and four are cytosolic; the sesquiterpene synthases are almost all cytosolic, with the exception of one found in the mitochondria; and three diterpene synthases are found in the plastids, one in the cytosol and two in the mitochondria. New trans-prenyltransferases (TPTs) were characterised; together with previously characterised TPTs and cis-prenyltransferases (CPTs), tomato plants can make all cis and trans C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; , C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; prenyl diphosphates. Every type of plant tissue examined expresses some TPS genes and some TPTs and CPTs. Phylogenetic comparison of the TPS genes from tomato and Arabidopsis shows expansions in each clade of the TPS gene family in each lineage (and inferred losses), accompanied by changes in subcellular localisations and substrate specificities.">

        <span class="abst" title="Micro RNAs (miRNAs) play crucial regulatory roles in multiple biological processes. Recently they have garnered the attention for their strong influence on the secondary metabolite production in plants. Their role in the regulation of artemisinin (ART) biosynthesis is, however, not fully elucidated. ART is a potent anti-malarial compound recommended by WHO for the treatment of drug-resistant malaria. It is produced byÂ Artemisia annua (A. annua).Â The lowerÂ in plantaÂ content of ART necessitates a deep understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of this metabolite. In this study, using modern high throughput small RNA-sequencing by Illumina Nextseq 500 platform for identification and stem-loop RT PCR for validation, miRNAs were identified in the leaf sample ofÂ A. annua plant. Here, we report a total of 121 miRNAs from A. annua that target several important genes and transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of ART. This study revealed the presence of some important conserved miRNA families, miR396, miR319, miR399, miR858, miR5083 and miR6111 not identified so far inÂ A. annua. The expression patterns and correlation between miRNAs and their corresponding targets at different developmental stages of the plant using real-time PCR indicate that they may influence ART accumulation. These findings thus, open new possibilities for the rational engineering of the secondary metabolite pathways in general and ART biosynthesis in particular.">

        <span class="abst" title="Raspberry (&lt;i&gt;Rubus&lt;/i&gt; sp.) is a berries fruit with an ongoing agricultural and commercial interest due to its high contents of flavonoids and nutrients beneficial for human health. The growing demand for raspberries is facing great challenges associated mainly with the dispersal of diseases, which produces a decrease in productivity and fruit quality. A broad range of genomic resources is available for other Rosaceae species; however, genomic resources for species of the &lt;i&gt;Rubus&lt;/i&gt; genus are still limited. Here, we characterize the transcriptome of the &lt;i&gt;Rubus idaeus&lt;/i&gt; (Var. Amira) in order to 1) provide clues in the transcriptional changes of &lt;i&gt;R.Â idaeus&lt;/i&gt; against tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV); and 2) generate genomic resources for this economically important species. We generate more than 200 million sequencing reads from two mRNA samples of raspberry, infected and not infected by ToRSV, using Illumina technology. After &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; assembly, we obtained 68,853 predicted protein-coding sequences of which 71.3% and 61.3% were annotated using Gene Ontology and Pfam databases, respectively. Moreover, we find 2,340 genes with differential expression between raspberries infected and not infected by ToRSV. Analysis of these genes shows functional enrichments of the oxidation-reduction process, cell wall biogenesis, terpene synthase activity, and lyase activity. These genes could be involved in the raspberry immune response through the interaction of different metabolic pathways; however, this statement needs further investigations. Up-regulation of genes encoding terpene synthases, multicopper oxidases, laccases, and beta-glucosidases might suggest that these enzymes appear to be the predominant transcriptome immune response of &lt;i&gt;R.Â idaeus&lt;/i&gt; against ToRSV. Furthermore, we identify thousands of molecular markers (i.e., SSRs and SNPs), increasing considerably the genomic resources currently available for raspberries. This study is the first report on investigating the transcriptional changes of &lt;i&gt;R.Â idaeus&lt;/i&gt; against ToRSV.">

By integrating the &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; genome and transcriptional data, 34 &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were found in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. These were divided into four subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, and TPS-e/f). Distinct tempospatial expression profiles of &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were observed in 10 organs of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. Most &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were predominantly expressed in flowers, followed by roots and stems. Expression of the majority of &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes was enhanced following exposure to cold and osmotic stresses. Recombinant DoTPS10 protein, located in chloroplasts, uniquely converted geranyl diphosphate to linalool in vitro. The &lt;i&gt;DoTPS10&lt;/i&gt; gene, which resulted in linalool formation, was highly expressed during all flower developmental stages. Methyl jasmonate significantly up-regulated &lt;i&gt;DoTPS10&lt;/i&gt; expression and linalool accumulation. These results simultaneously provide valuable insight into understanding the roles of the TPS family and lay a basis for further studies on the regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis by &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;.">

We generated a 558â€‰Mb draft genome assembly for snowberry which encodes 28,707 high-confidence genes. Comparative analyses with other angiosperm genomes revealed enrichment in snowberry of lineage-specific genes involved in specialized metabolism. Synteny between snowberry and Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner (coffee) was evident, including the chromosomal region encoding caffeine biosynthesis in coffee, albeit syntelogs of N-methyltransferase were absent in snowberry. A total of 27 putative terpene synthase genes were identified, including 10 that encode diterpene synthases. Functional validation of a subset of putative terpene synthases revealed that combinations of diterpene synthases yielded access to products of both general and specialized metabolism. Specifically, we identified plausible intermediates in the biosynthesis of merilactone and ribenone, structurally unique antimicrobial diterpene natural products. Access to the C. alba genome will enable additional characterization of biosynthetic pathways responsible for health-promoting compounds in this medicinal species.">

Here we engineer &lt;i&gt;Yarrowia lipolytica&lt;/i&gt; platform strains for the overproduction of mono-, sesqui-, di-, tri-, and tetraterpenoids. The monoterpene platform strain was evaluated by expressing &lt;i&gt;Perilla frutescens&lt;/i&gt; limonene synthase, which resulted in limonene titer of 35.9 mg/L and was 100-fold higher than when the same enzyme was expressed in the strain without mevalonate pathway improvement. Expression of &lt;i&gt;Callitropsis nootkatensis&lt;/i&gt; valencene synthase in the sesquiterpene platform strain resulted in 113.9 mg/L valencene, an 8.4-fold increase over the control strain. Platform strains for production of squalene, complex triterpenes, or diterpenes and carotenoids were also constructed and resulted in the production of 402.4 mg/L squalene, 22 mg/L 2,3-oxidosqualene, or 164 mg/L Î²-carotene, respectively. The presented terpenoid platform strains can facilitate the evaluation of terpenoid biosynthetic pathways and are a convenient starting point for constructing efficient cell factories for the production of various terpenoids. The platform strains and exemplary terpenoid strains can be obtained from Euroscarf.">

Here, we compared berries subjected to natural or accelerated dehydration, the latter driven by forced air flow. We followed the evolution of transcript and metabolite profiles and found that accelerated dehydration clearly dampened the natural transcriptomic and metabolomic programs of postharvest berries. We found that slow dehydration over a prolonged duration is necessary to induce gene expression and metabolite accumulation associated with the final quality traits of dehydrated berries. The accumulation of key metabolites (particularly stilbenoids) during postharvest dehydration is inhibited by rapid dehydration conditions that shorten the berry life time.">

While monoterpenoids and lignans have been linked to rot resistance in this species, other specialized metabolites, such as diterpenes, are likely to contribute to rot resistance. Here we report the cloning and functional assessment of three putative diterpene synthase (TpdiTPS) genes expressed during heartwood formation in WRC. The predicted proteins of the three genes lack either of the two catalytically independent active sites typical of most diTPS, indicating monofunctional rather than bifunctional activity. To identify potential catalytic activities of these proteins, we expressed them in genetically engineered Escherichia coli strains that produce four potential substrates, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP), ent, syn, and normal stereoisomers of copalyl diphosphate (CDP). We found that TpdiTPS3 used GGDP to produce CDP. TpdiTPS2 used normal CDP to produce levopimaradiene. TpdiTPS1 showed stereoselectivity as it used normal CDP to produce sandaracopimaradiene and syn-CDP to produce syn-stemod-13(17)-ene. These genes and protein enzymatic activities have not been previously reported in WRC and provide an opportunity to assess their potential roles in heartwood rot resistance in this economically important species.">

Here, we explore the potential for SM production in Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota, two phyla of nonflagellated fungi that are not members of Dikarya, by predicting and identifying core genes and gene clusters involved in SM. The majority of non-Dikarya have few genes and gene clusters involved in SM production except for the amphibian gut symbionts in the genus &lt;i&gt;Basidiobolus&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Basidiobolus&lt;/i&gt; genomes exhibit an enrichment of SM genes involved in siderophore, surfactin-like, and terpene cyclase production, all these with evidence of constitutive gene expression.

Shark Bay, Australia has some of the best examples of modern microbial mats thriving under harsh conditions of high temperatures, salinity, desiccation, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Microorganisms living in extreme ecosystems are thought to potentially encode for secondary metabolites as a survival strategy. Many secondary metabolites are natural products encoded by a grouping of genes known as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Natural products have diverse chemical structures and functions which provide competitive advantages for microorganisms and can also have biotechnology applications. In the present study, the diversity of BGC were described in detail for the first time from Shark Bay microbial mats. A total of 1477 BGCs were detected in metagenomic data over a 20 mm mat depth horizon, with the surface layer possessing over 200 BGCs and containing the highest relative abundance of BGCs of all mat layers. Terpene and bacteriocin BGCs were highly represented and their natural products are proposed to have important roles in ecosystem function in these mat systems. Interestingly, potentially novel BGCs were detected from Heimdallarchaeota and Lokiarchaeota, two evolutionarily significant archaeal phyla not previously known to possess BGCs. This study provides new insights into how secondary metabolites from BGCs may enable diverse microbial mat communities to adapt to extreme environments.">

(American beautyberry), a species within the early-diverging Callicarpoideae clade of Lamiaceae, known for its metallic purple fruits and use as an insect repellent due to its production of terpenoids. Using long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding, we generated a 506.1-Mb assembly spanning 17 pseudomolecules with N50 contig and N50 scaffold sizes of 7.5 and 29.0 Mb, respectively. In all, 32,164 genes were annotated, including 53 candidate terpene synthases and 47 putative clusters of specialized metabolite biosynthetic pathways. Our analyses revealed 3 putative whole-genome duplication events, which, together with local tandem duplications, contributed to gene family expansion of terpene synthases. Kolavenyl diphosphate is a gateway to many of the bioactive terpenoids in C. americana; experimental validation confirmed that CamTPS2 encodes kolavenyl diphosphate synthase. Syntenic analyses with Tectona grandis L. f. (teak), a member of the Tectonoideae clade of Lamiaceae known for exceptionally strong wood resistant to insects, revealed 963 collinear blocks and 21,297 C. americana syntelogs.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Access to the C. americana genome provides a road map for rapid discovery of genes encoding plant-derived agrichemicals and a key resource for understanding the evolution of chemical diversity in Lamiaceae.">

In this study, we assemble a 3.26-Gb high-quality chromosome-scale genome for the 'Longjing 43' cultivar of Camellia sinensis var. sinensis. Genomic resequencing of 139 tea accessions from around the world is used to investigate the evolution and phylogenetic relationships of tea accessions. We find that hybridization has increased the heterozygosity and wide-ranging gene flow among tea populations with the spread of tea cultivation. Population genetic and transcriptomic analyses reveal that during domestication, selection for disease resistance and flavor in C. sinensis var. sinensis populations has been stronger than that in C. sinensis var. assamica populations. This study provides resources for marker-assisted breeding of tea and sets the foundation for further research on tea genetics and evolution.">

State-regulated medical cannabis programs rely on breeder-reported &quot;strain&quot; names both within diversion control systems and to describe the medical cannabis products that are sold to patients in medical cannabis dispensaries. In state-regulated medical cannabis programs, there is no conventional nomenclature system that correlates the breeder-reported names with their profiles of active ingredients, and these &quot;strain&quot; names are invalid as they refer to chemical differences properly referred to as to chemovars. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; To determine the actual levels of chemical diversity represented in 2662 samples of &lt;i&gt;Cannabis&lt;/i&gt; flower collected between January 2016 and June of 2017 in Nevada, chemical profile data were measured from these samples by a state-qualified third-party testing laboratory. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to define clusters in data sets representing both cannabinoids and terpenoids, cannabinoids only, or terpenoids only. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The PCA of the terpenoid only data set revealed three well-defined clusters. All three terpenoids only data clusters had high tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase, but the terpene profiles listed in reverse-order of abundance best defined these chemovars. The three chemovars in Nevada were labeled with 396 breeder-reported sample names, which overestimate the diversity and do not inform patients regarding chemical properties. Representative DNA samples were taken from each chemovar to determine whether the genetic diversity was greater than the chemical diversity. The limited genotyping experiment was based on DNA sequence polymorphisms. The genetic analysis revealed twelve distinct genetic clades, which still does not account for the entirety of the 396 reported sample names. The finite genotypes did not correlate with the chemotypes determined for the samples. This suggests that either the DNA-markers used were too narrowly restricted for factual separation or that environmental factors contributed more significantly to the chemical profiles of cannabis than genetics. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The three chemovars and twelve genotypes reflect low medical diversity on the market in Nevada during its &quot;medical use only&quot; phase. Furthermore, the 396 breeder-reported sample names within this set imply a false sense of diversity of products in Nevada dispensaries.">

Although transcriptomic studies have been done to infer the molecular mechanisms of plant defense against GB, little is known about the effect of GB infestation on the switchgrass protein expression and phosphorylation regulation. The global response of the switchgrass cultivar Summer proteome and phosphoproteome was monitored by label-free proteomics shotgun in GB-infested and uninfested control plants at 10Â days post infestation. Peptides matching a total of 3,594 proteins were identified and 429 were differentially expressed proteins in GB-infested plants relative to uninfested control plants. Among these, 291 and 138 were up and downregulated by GB infestation, respectively. Phosphoproteome analysis identified 310 differentially phosphorylated proteins (DP) from 350 phosphopeptides with a total of 399 phosphorylated sites. These phosphopeptides had more serine phosphorylated residues (79%), compared to threonine phosphorylated sites (21%). Overall, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that GB feeding led to the enriched accumulation of proteins important for biosynthesis of plant defense secondary metabolites and repressed the accumulation of proteins involved in photosynthesis. Interestingly, defense modulators such as terpene synthase, papain-like cysteine protease, serine carboxypeptidase, and lipoxygenase2 were upregulated at the proteome level, corroborating previously published transcriptomic data.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpene synthases (TPSs) and trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) are among the core enzymes for creating the enormous diversity of terpenoids. Despite having no sequence homology, TPSs and IDSs share a conserved &quot;Î± terpenoid synthase fold&quot; and a trinuclear metal cluster for catalysis, implying a common ancestry with TPSs hypothesized to evolve from IDSs anciently. Here we report on the identification and functional characterization of novel IDS-like TPSs (ILTPSs) in fungi that evolved from IDS relatively recently, indicating recurrent evolution of TPSs from IDSs. Through large-scale bioinformatic analyses of fungal IDSs, putative ILTPSs that belong to the geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS) family of IDSs were identified in three species of Melampsora. Among the GGDPS family of the two Melampsora species experimentally characterized, one enzyme was verified to be bona fide GGDPS and all others were demonstrated to function as TPSs. Melampsora ILTPSs displayed kinetic parameters similar to those of classic TPSs. Key residues underlying the determination of GGDPS versus ILTPS activity and functional divergence of ILTPSs were identified. Phylogenetic analysis implies a recent origination of these ILTPSs from a GGDPS progenitor in fungi, after the split of Melampsora from other genera within the class of Pucciniomycetes. For the poplar leaf rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina, the transcripts of its ILTPS genes were detected in infected poplar leaves, suggesting possible involvement of these recently evolved ILTPS genes in the infection process. This study reveals the recurrent evolution of TPSs from IDSs since their ancient occurrence and points to the possibility of a wide distribution of ILTPS genes in three domains of life.">

Chemical studies have revealed that R. molle contains abundant secondary metabolites such as terpenoinds, flavonoids and lignans, some of which have exhibited various bioactivities including antioxidant, hypotension and analgesic activity. In spite of immense pharmaceutical importance, the mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites remains unknown and the genomic information is unavailable.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;To gain molecular insight into this plant, especially on the information of pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites including grayanane diterpenoids, we conducted deep transcriptome sequencing for R. molle flower and root using the Illumina Hiseq platform. In total, 100,603 unigenes were generated through de novo assembly with mean length of 778â€‰bp, 57.1% of these unigenes were annotated in public databases and 17,906 of those unigenes showed significant match in the KEGG database. Unigenes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were annotated, including the TPSs and CYPs that were potentially responsible for the biosynthesis of grayanoids. Moreover, 3376 transcription factors and 10,828 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also identified. Additionally, we further performed differential gene expression (DEG) analysis of the flower and root transcriptome libraries and identified numerous genes that were specifically expressed or up-regulated in flower.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to generate and thoroughly analyze the transcriptome data of both R. molle flower and root. This study provided an important genetic resource which will shed light on elucidating various secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways in R. molle, especially for those with medicinal value and allow for drug development in this plant.">

Many insects harbour actinobacteria on their bodies or in their nests and use these metabolites for protection. However, some actinobacteria produce metabolites that are toxic to insects and the evolutionary relevance of this toxicity is unknown. Here we explore chemical interactions between streptomycetes and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We find that many streptomycetes produce specialized metabolites that have potent larvicidal effects against the fly; larvae that ingest spores of these species die. The mechanism of toxicity is specific to the bacterium's chemical arsenal: cosmomycin D producing bacteria induce a cell death-like response in the larval digestive tract; avermectin producing bacteria induce paralysis. Furthermore, low concentrations of volatile terpenes like 2-methylisoborneol that are produced by streptomycetes attract fruit flies such that they preferentially deposit their eggs on contaminated food sources. The resulting larvae are killed during growth and development. The phenomenon of volatile-mediated attraction and specialized metabolite toxicity suggests that some streptomycetes pose an evolutionary risk to insects in nature.">

By sequencing and assembling the first genome from this genus, we show that this fungus has genes for at least 20 natural products and that many of these products are likely novel. One of these metabolites is identified: a new, red-pigmented member of the azaphilone class, hyphodiscorubrin. We show that this metabolite is only produced when the fungus is grown in the light.

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoid metabolism plays vital roles in stress defense and the environmental adaptation of monocot crops. Here, we describe the identification of the terpene synthase (TPS) gene family of the panicoid food and bioenergy model crop foxtail millet (Setaria italica). The diploid S. italica genome contains 32 TPS genes, 17 of which were biochemically characterized in this study. Unlike other thus far investigated grasses, S. italica contains TPSs producing all three ent-, (+)- and syn-copalyl pyrophosphate stereoisomers that naturally occur as central building blocks in the biosynthesis of distinct monocot diterpenoids. Conversion of these intermediates by the promiscuous TPS SiTPS8 yielded different diterpenoid scaffolds. Additionally, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP99A17), which genomically clustered with SiTPS8, catalyzes the C19 hydroxylation of SiTPS8 products to generate the corresponding diterpene alcohols. The presence of syntenic orthologs to about 19% of the S. italica TPSs in related grasses supports a common ancestry of selected pathway branches. Among the identified enzyme products, abietadien-19-ol, syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol and germacrene-d-4-ol were detectable in planta, and gene expression analysis of the biosynthetic TPSs showed distinct and, albeit moderately, inducible expression patterns in response to biotic and abiotic stress. In vitro growth-inhibiting activity of abietadien-19-ol and syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol against Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium subglutinans may indicate pathogen defensive functions, whereas the low antifungal efficacy of tested sesquiterpenoids supports other bioactivities. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of monocot terpenoid metabolism to enable further investigations of terpenoid-mediated stress resilience in these agriculturally important species.">

        <span class="abst" title="Rhodococci are renowned for their great metabolic repertoire partly because of their numerous putative pathways for large number of specialized metabolites such as biosurfactant. Screening and genome-based assessment for the capacity to produce surface-active molecules was conducted on &lt;i&gt;Rhodococcus&lt;/i&gt; sp. ADL36, a diesel-degrading Antarctic bacterium. The strain showed a positive bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay, drop collapse test, oil displacement activity, microplate assay, maximal emulsification index at 45% and ability to reduce water surface tension to &lt; 30 mN/m. The evaluation of the cell-free supernatant demonstrated its high stability across the temperature, pH and salinity gradient although no correlation was found between the surface and emulsification activity. Based on the positive relationship between the assessment of macromolecules content and infrared analysis, the extracted biosurfactant synthesized was classified as a lipopeptide. Prediction of the secondary metabolites in the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) clusters suggested the likelihood of the surface-active lipopeptide production in the strain's genomic data. This is the third report of surface-active lipopeptide producers from this phylotype and the first from the polar region. The lipopeptide synthesized by ADL36 has the prospect to be an Antarctic remediation tool while furnishing a distinctive natural product for biotechnological application and research.">

Towards producing heterologous monoterpenes in spearmint, we first reduced the flux into the native limonene pathway by knocking down the expression of limonene synthase (&lt;i&gt;MsLS&lt;/i&gt;) by RNAi method. The &lt;i&gt;MsLS&lt;/i&gt; RNAi lines exhibited a huge reduction in the synthesis of limonene and carvone. Detailed GC-MS and LC-MS analysis revealed that &lt;i&gt;MsLS&lt;/i&gt; RNAi plants also showed an increase in sesquiterpene, phytosterols, fatty acids, flavonoids, and phenolic metabolites, suggesting an interaction between the MEP, MVA shikimate and fatty acid pathways in spearmint. Three different heterologous monoterpene synthases namely, linalool synthase and myrcene synthase from &lt;i&gt;Picea abies&lt;/i&gt; and geraniol synthase from &lt;i&gt;Cananga odorata&lt;/i&gt; were cloned and introduced independently into the &lt;i&gt;MsLS&lt;/i&gt; RNAi mutant background. The expression of these heterologous terpene synthases resulted mainly in production of monoterpene derivatives. Of all the introduced monoterpenes geraniol showed the maximum number of derivatives. Our results provide new insights into MEP pathway interactions and regulation and reveals the existence of mechanisms for complex metabolism of monoterpenes in spearmint.">

The pathogenicity of these fungi is typically accompanied by increased adhesion and formation of complex biofilms, making candidal infections challenging to treat. Although a variety of antifungal drugs have been developed that preferably attack the fungal cell wall and plasma membrane, these pathogens have acquired novel defense mechanisms that make them resistant to standard treatment. This causes an increase in the incidence of candidiasis and enforces the urgent need for an intensified search for new specifics that could be helpful, alone or synergistically with traditional drugs, for controlling &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity. Currently, numerous reports have indicated the effectiveness of plant metabolites as potent antifungal agents. These substances have been shown to inhibit growth and to alter the virulence of different &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species in both the planktonic and hyphal form and during the biofilm formation. This review focuses on the most recent findings that provide evidence of decreasing candidal pathogenicity by different substances of plant origin, with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of their action. This is a particularly important issue in the light of the currently increasing frequency of emerging &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; strains and species resistant to standard antifungal treatment.">

A total 25 monoterpenes and 11 sesquiterpenes were identified in leaf tissue from the 4 species. Genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of precursors for mono- and sesqui-terpene synthases were identified in all four species. Across all 4 species, a total of 235 terpene synthases were identified, ranging from 27 in O. majorana to 137 in the tetraploid O. basilicum.

        <span class="abst" title="The medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Catharanthus roseus&lt;/i&gt; produces numerous secondary metabolites of interest for the treatment of many diseases - most notably for the terpene indole alkaloid (TIA) vinblastine, which is used in the treatment of leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Historically, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) has been used to induce TIA production, but in the past, this has only been investigated in whole seedlings, cell culture, or hairy root culture. This study examines the effects of the phytohormones MeJA and ethylene on the induction of TIA biosynthesis and accumulation in the shoots and roots of 8-day-old seedlings of two varieties of &lt;i&gt;C. roseus&lt;/i&gt;. Using LCMS and RT-qPCR, we demonstrate the importance of variety selection, as we observe markedly different induction patterns of important TIA precursor compounds. Additionally, both phytohormone choice and concentration have significant effects on TIA biosynthesis. Finally, our study suggests that several early-induction pathway steps as well as pathway-specific genes are likely to be transcriptionally regulated. Our findings highlight the need for a complete set of'omics resources in commonly used &lt;i&gt;C. roseus&lt;/i&gt; varieties and the need for caution when extrapolating results from one cultivar to another.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cyanobacteria, the largest phylum of prokaryotes, perform oxygenic photosynthesis and are regarded as the ancestors of the plant chloroplast and the purveyors of the oxygen and biomass that shaped the biosphere. Nowadays, cyanobacteria are attracting a growing interest in being able to use solar energy, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and minerals to produce biotechnologically interesting chemicals. This often requires the introduction and expression of heterologous genes encoding the enzymes that are not present in natural cyanobacteria. However, only a handful of model strains with a well-established genetic system are being studied so far, leaving the vast biodiversity of cyanobacteria poorly understood and exploited. In this study, we focused on the robust unicellular cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Cyanothece&lt;/i&gt; PCC 7425 that has many interesting attributes, such as large cell size; capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen (under anaerobiosis) and to grow not only on nitrate but also on urea (a frequent pollutant) as the sole nitrogen source; capacity to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sequestrating intracellular calcium carbonate granules and to produce various biotechnologically interesting products. We demonstrate for the first time that RSF1010-derived plasmid vectors can be used for promoter analysis, as well as constitutive or temperature-controlled overproduction of proteins and analysis of their sub-cellular localization in &lt;i&gt;Cyanothece&lt;/i&gt; PCC 7425. These findings are important because no gene manipulation system had been developed for &lt;i&gt;Cyanothece&lt;/i&gt; PCC 7425, yet, handicapping its potential to serve as a model host. Furthermore, using this toolbox, we engineered &lt;i&gt;Cyanothece&lt;/i&gt; PCC 7425 to produce the high-value terpene, limonene which has applications in biofuels, bioplastics, cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries. This is the first report of the engineering of a &lt;i&gt;Cyanothece&lt;/i&gt; strain for the production of a chemical and the first demonstration that terpene can be produced by an engineered cyanobacterium growing on urea as the sole nitrogen source.">

An additional enhancement of cis-abienol production (up to 8.6Â mg/L) was achieved by introducing an exogenous mevalonate pathway which was divided into the upper pathway containing acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase/HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase and the lower pathway containing mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, pyrophosphate mevalonate decarboxylase and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase. The genetically modified strain carrying chromosomal copy of low genes of the mevalonate with the trc promoter accumulated cis-abienol up to 9.2Â mg/L in shake flask. Finally, cis-abienol titers ofâ€‰~â€‰220Â mg/L could be achieved directly from glucose using this de novo cis-abienol-producing E. coli in high-cell-density fermentation.

The monophagous beetle Agasicles hygrophila uses a volatile (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonanetriene (DMNT) to recognize its host plant Alternanthera philoxeroides. Alternanthera philoxeroides releases DMNT in response to A. hygrophila attack and nerolidol synthase (NES) is a key enzyme in DMNT biosynthesis; however, the effect of A. hygrophila on NES expression remains unclear. In this study, the A. philoxeroides transcriptome was sequenced and six putative NES genes belonging to the terpene synthase-g family were characterized. The expression of these NES genes was assayed at different times following A. hygrophila contact, feeding or mechanical wounding. Results showed that A. hygrophila contact and feeding induced NES expression more rapidly and more intensely than mechanical wounding alone. This may account for a large release of DMNT following A. hygrophila feeding in a previous study and subsequently facilitate A. hygrophila to find host plants. Our research provides a powerful genetic platform for studying invasive plants and lays the foundation for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between A. philoxeroides and its specialist A. hygrophila.">

When &lt;i&gt;P. oligandrum&lt;/i&gt; colonizes grapevine roots, it was observed that the wood necroses caused by &lt;i&gt;P. chlamydospora&lt;/i&gt; were significantly reduced. Transcriptomic analyses of plant and fungus responses were performed to determine the molecular events occurring, with the aim to relate &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;chlamydospora&lt;/i&gt; degradation of wood to gene expression modulation. Following &lt;i&gt;P. oligandrum&lt;/i&gt;-root colonization, major transcriptomic changes occurred both, in the grapevine-defense system and in the &lt;i&gt;P. chlamydospore&lt;/i&gt;-virulence factors.

Shifts in grapevine responses and key-fungal functions were associated with the reduction of &lt;i&gt;P. chlamydospora&lt;/i&gt; wood necroses. This study provides evidence of wood fungal pathogen transcriptional changes induced by a root biocontrol agent, &lt;i&gt;P. oligandrum&lt;/i&gt;, in which there is no contact between the two microorganisms.">

Illumina GAIIx sequencing of plants collected during end of vegetative growth (August) yielded 48,411 unigenes. 74.45% of these were annotated using UNIPROT. GO enrichment analysis, KEGG pathways and PPI network indicated simultaneous utilization of leaf photosynthates for flowering, rhizome fortification, stress response and tissue-specific secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Among the secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes, terpenoids were predominant. UPLC-PDA analysis of in vitro plants revealed temperature-dependent, tissue-specific differential distribution of various phenolics. Thus, as compared to 25Â Â°C, the phenolic contents of both leaves (gallic acid and rutin) and roots (p-coumaric acid and cinnamic acid) were higher at 15Â Â°C. These phenolics accounted for the therapeutic properties reported in the plant. In qRT-PCR of in vitro plants, secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway genes showed higher expression at 15Â Â°C and 14Â h/10Â h photoperiod (conditions representing end of vegetative growth period). This provided cues for in vitro modulation of identified secondary metabolites. Such modulation of secondary metabolites in in vitro systems can eliminate the need for uprooting N. jatamansi from wild. Hence, the study is a step towards effective conservation of the plant.">

By optimizing the C/N ratio, controlling the media pH and mitigating acetyl-CoA flux competition from lipogenesis, the engineered strain produced 502.7Â mg/L squalene, a 28-fold increase over the parental strain (17.2Â mg/L). This work may serve as a baseline to harness Y. lipolytica as an oleaginous cell factory for sustainable production of squalene or terpenoids-based chemicals and natural products.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Flammulina filiformis (previously known as Asian F. velutipes) is a popular commercial edible mushroom. Many bioactive compounds with medicinal effects, such as polysaccharides and sesquiterpenoids, have been isolated and identified from F. filiformis, but their biosynthesis and regulation at the molecular level remains unclear. In this study, we sequenced the genome of the wild strain F. filiformis Liu355, predicted its biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and profiled the expression of these genes in wild and cultivar strains and in different developmental stages of the wild F. filiformis strain by a comparative transcriptomic analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We found that the genome of the F. filiformis was 35.01â€‰Mb in length and harbored 10,396 gene models. Thirteen putative terpenoid gene clusters were predicted and 12 sesquiterpene synthase genes belonging to four different groups and two type I polyketide synthase gene clusters were identified in the F. filiformis genome. The number of genes related to terpenoid biosynthesis was higher in the wild strain (119 genes) than in the cultivar strain (81 genes). Most terpenoid biosynthesis genes were upregulated in the primordium and fruiting body of the wild strain, while the polyketide synthase genes were generally upregulated in the mycelium of the wild strain. Moreover, genes encoding UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which are involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, had relatively high transcript levels both in the mycelium and fruiting body of the wild F. filiformis strain.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;F. filiformis is enriched in a number of gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and terpenoid bioactive compounds and these genes usually display differential expression between wild and cultivar strains, even in different developmental stages. This study expands our knowledge of the biology of F. filiformis and provides valuable data for elucidating the regulation of secondary metabolites in this unique F. filiformis strain.">

In this study, three potential geraniol synthases were mined from the &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; genome. DoGES1, which was localized in chloroplasts, was characterized as a geraniol synthase. &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in flowers, especially in petals. &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; transcript levels were high in the budding stage of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; flowers at 11:00 a.m. DoGES1 catalyzed geraniol in vitro, and transient expression of &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; leaves resulted in the accumulation of geraniol in vivo. These findings on DoGES1 advance our understanding of geraniol biosynthesis in orchids, and lay the basis for genetic modification of floral scent in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; or in other ornamental orchids.">

Consequently, a myriad of mechanisms has evolved to engage organisms in different types of interactions. These interactions can be mediated by allelochemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which include volatile terpenes (VTs). The emission of VTs provides a way for plants to communicate with the environment, including neighboring plants, beneficiaries (e.g., pollinators, seed dispersers), predators, parasitoids, and herbivores, by sending enticing or deterring signals. Understanding terpenoid distribution, biogenesis, and function provides an opportunity for the design and implementation of effective and efficient environmental calamity and pest management strategies.

Peach aroma is important for consumer preference and determined by underlying metabolic pathways and gene expression. Differences in aroma (profiles of volatile organic compounds, VOCs) have been widely reported across cultivars and in response to cold storage. However, few studies used intact peaches, or used equilibrium sampling methods subject to saturation. We analysed VOC profiles using TD-GCâ€‰Ã—â€‰GC-ToF-MS and expression of 12 key VOC pathway genes of intact fruit from six cultivars (three peaches, three nectarines) before and after storage at 1Â Â°C for 7Â days including 36Â h shelf life storage at 20Â Â°C. Two dimensional GC (GCâ€‰Ã—â€‰GC) significantly enhances discrimination of thermal desorption gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TD-GC-ToF-MS) and detected a total of 115 VOCs. A subset of 15 VOCs from analysis with Random Forest discriminated between cultivars. Another 16 VOCs correlated strongly with expression profiles of eleven key genes in the lipoxygenase pathway, and both expression profiles and VOCs discriminated amongst cultivars, peach versus nectarines and between treatments. The cultivar-specific response to cold storage underlines the need to understand more fully the genetic basis for VOC changes across cultivars.">

The production of azadirachtin A depends on extraction from neem tissues, which is not an eco-friendly and sustainable process. The low yield and discontinuous supply of azadirachtin A impedes further applications. The biosynthetic pathway of azadirachtin A is still unknown and is the focus of our study.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We attempted to explore azadirachtin A biosynthetic pathway and identified the key genes involved by analyzing transcriptome data from five neem tissues through the hybrid-sequencing (Illumina HiSeq and Pacific Biosciences Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT)) approach. Candidates were first screened by comparing the expression levels between the five tissues. After phylogenetic analysis, domain prediction, and molecular docking studies, 22 candidates encoding 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC), alcohol dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 (CYP450), acyltransferase, and esterase were proposed to be potential genes involved in azadirachtin A biosynthesis. Among them, two unigenes encoding homologs of MaOSC1 and MaCYP71CD2 were identified. A unigene encoding the complete homolog of MaCYP71BQ5 was reported. Accuracy of the assembly was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and full-length PCR cloning.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;By integrating and analyzing transcriptome data from hybrid-seq technology, 22 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were finally selected as candidates involved in azadirachtin A pathway. The obtained reliable and accurate sequencing data provided important novel information for understanding neem genome. Our data shed new light on understanding the biosynthesis of other triterpenoids in neem trees and provides a reference for exploring other valuable natural product biosynthesis in plants.">

Considering the potential of the related genera within the family, namely &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kitasatospora&lt;/i&gt;, these relatively new members of the family can also be a promising source for novel secondary metabolites. At present, 15 genome data for 11 species from this genus are available, which can provide valuable information on their biology including the potential for metabolite production as well as enzymatic activities in comparison to the neighboring taxa. In this study, the genome sequences of 11 &lt;i&gt;Streptacidiphilus&lt;/i&gt; species were subjected to the comparative analysis together with selected &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kitasatospora&lt;/i&gt; genomes. This study represents the first comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the genus &lt;i&gt;Streptacidiphilus&lt;/i&gt;. The results indicate that the genomes of &lt;i&gt;Streptacidiphilus&lt;/i&gt; contained various secondary metabolite (SM) producing biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), some of them exclusively identified in &lt;i&gt;Streptacidiphilus&lt;/i&gt; only. Several of these clusters may potentially code for SMs that may have a broad range of bioactivities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial and antitumor activities. The biodegradation capabilities of &lt;i&gt;Streptacidiphilus&lt;/i&gt; were also explored by investigating the hydrolytic enzymes for complex carbohydrates. Although all genomes were enriched with carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), their numbers in the genomes of some strains such as Streptacidiphilus carbonis NBRC 100919&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; were higher as compared to well-known carbohydrate degrading organisms. These distinctive features of each &lt;i&gt;Streptacidiphilus&lt;/i&gt; species make them interesting candidates for future studies with respect to their potential for SM production and enzymatic activities.">

The beneficial effects of these species are supported by the secondary metabolites they produce. Terpenoid compounds are key players in the interaction of &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; spp. with the environment and with their fungal and plant hosts; however, most of the terpene synthase (TS) genes involved in their biosynthesis have yet not been characterized. Here, we combined comparative genomics of TSs of 21 strains belonging to 17 &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; spp., and gene expression studies on TSs using &lt;i&gt;T. gamsii&lt;/i&gt; T6085 as a model. An overview of the diversity within the TS-gene family and the regulation of TS genes is provided. We identified 15 groups of TSs, and the presence of clade-specific enzymes revealed a variety of terpenoid chemotypes evolved to cover different ecological demands. We propose that functional differentiation of gene family members is the driver for the high number of TS genes found in the genomes of &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt;. Expression studies provide a picture in which different TS genes are regulated in many ways, which is a strong indication of different biological functions.">

        <span class="abst" title="We report the acquisition of a high-quality haploid chromosome-scale genome assembly for the first time in a tree species, Eucommia ulmoides, which is known for its rubber biosynthesis and medicinal applications. The assembly was obtained by applying PacBio and Hi-C technologies to a haploid that we specifically generated. Compared to the initial genome release, this one has significantly improved assembly quality. The scaffold N50 (53.15â€‰MB) increased 28-fold, and the repetitive sequence content (520â€‰Mb) increased by 158.24â€‰Mb, whereas the number of gaps decreased from 104,772 to 128. A total of 92.87% of the 26,001 predicted protein-coding genes identified with multiple strategies were anchored to the 17 chromosomes. A new whole-genome duplication event was superimposed on the earlier Î³ paleohexaploidization event, and the expansion of long terminal repeats contributed greatly to the evolution of the genome. The more primitive rubber biosynthesis of this species, as opposed to that in Hevea brasiliensis, relies on the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway rather than the mevalonate pathway to synthesize isoprenyl diphosphate, as the MEP pathway operates predominantly in trans-polyisoprene-containing leaves and central peels. Chlorogenic acid biosynthesis pathway enzymes were preferentially expressed in leaves rather than in bark. This assembly with higher sequence contiguity can foster not only studies on genome structure and evolution, gene mapping, epigenetic analysis and functional genomics but also efforts to improve E. ulmoides for industrial and medical uses through genetic engineering.">

Terpene VOC production may be altered after damage or by biological stimuli such as bacterial, fungal and insects, and subsequent triggering of plant defense responses. These VOCs originate in plants from two independent pathways: the mevalonate and the methylerythritol phosphate pathways, which utilize dimethylallyl and isopentenyl diphosphates to form the terpenoidal precursors. Phakopsora pachyrhizi fungi causes Asian soybean rust, limiting soybean production and resulting in losses of up to 80% if no control strategies are applied. By using a transcriptome datasets, we investigated the regulation of genes of the mevalonate pathway under different biotic stresses. We studied the impact of P. pachyrhizi infection in vivo expression profile of genes involved in terpenoid and glyceollin biosynthesis in genotypes harboring different resistance genes (Rpp), and across the infection cycle. In addition, we used UPLC and UPGC analysis to evaluate glyceollin and VOC production, respectively, to identify metabolites associated with soybean responses to pathogen infection. The regulation of soybean genes involved in terpene production was influenced by genotypes, depending on the Rpp gene, while glyceollin was induced in all genotypes. Furthermore, a sesquiterpene was identified as a potential marker associated with rust symptoms on soybean.">

The experiment was performed to elucidate the expression of candidate genes associated with andrographolide biosynthesis. Based on results obtained in chromatography for andrographolide content analysis of six genotypes, two contrast genotypes, i.e. IC-520361 (maximum andrographolide content-2.33%) and Anand Local (lowest andrographolide content-1.01%) were selected for the transcriptome analysis. A total of 1.04Â Gb of raw data were produced using MiSeq Illumina platform, in which IC 520361 generated 645 million base pairs sequence along with 4,524,251 raw reads and Anand Local produced 419 million base pairs sequence along with 3,021,316 raw reads. The combined assembly of high quality reads generated for both the samples had 33,247,454Â bp of total assembled bases and 38,292 of transcripts. The GC percent of assembled transcripts was 44.79%, an average read length was 800Â bp and N&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value was 1186Â bp. Species-specific distribution using BLAST X (Nr), showed the highest Blast hits with &lt;i&gt;Sesamum indicum.&lt;/i&gt; Out of 23,346 transcripts, 87% of transcripts annotated in UniProt KB (Universal Protein Resource KnowledgeBase) database and only 0.21% of transcripts were annotated in TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resources). Biological processes gene ontology classified based on Blast2GO showed, out of 6853 transcripts, 1370 of transcripts were represented by terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, which involved in secondary metabolite andrographolide biosynthesis. The heat map showed 1016 transcripts were differentially expressed between two kalmegh genotypes, in which nine important differentially expressed transcripts related to MEP (2C methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate) and MVA (Mevalonic acid) andrographolide biosynthesis pathways such as, geranyl diphosphate synthase small subunit, Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase i-like, 4, 13-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase etc. were upregulated in IC 520361 as compared to Anand Local, which were validated through RT-qPCR. The highest expression of gene 13-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase (HMGR) was reported, which is responsible for accumulation of andrographolide in leaf. This comparative transcriptome analysis confirmed the expression level of genes were higher in accession IC 520361 as compare to Anand Local related to andrographolide biosynthesis pathways i.e. MEP and MVA. These up-regulated genes could be over-expressed to enhance the andrographolide content using genetic engineering of these metabolic pathways. It will also give an idea to the breeder for development of molecular markers for direct screening of the genotypes.">

The typical vibriosis, acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), has resulted in mass mortality and devastating economic losses. Thus, therapeutic strategies are highly needed to decrease the risk of vibriosis outbreaks. Herein, we initially identified that the growth of the causative agent of AHPND, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&lt;/i&gt; (VP &lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;AHPND&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ) and other vibrios in Pacific white shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Litopenaeus vannamei&lt;/i&gt;) was inhibited by a &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; strain BSXE-1601. The natural products amicoumacins A, B, and C were purified from the cell-free supernatant from the strain BSXE-1601, but only amicoumacin A was demonstrated to be responsible for this anti-&lt;i&gt;Vibrio&lt;/i&gt; activity. Our discovery provided the first evidence that amicoumacin A was highly active against shrimp pathogens, including the representative strain VP &lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;AHPND&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; . Furthermore, we elucidated the amicoumacin A biosynthetic gene cluster by whole genome sequencing of the &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; strain BSXE-1601. In addition to amicoumacin A, the strain BSXE-1601 genome harbored other genes encoding bacillibactin, fengycin, surfactin, bacilysin, and subtilosin A, all of which have previously reported antagonistic activities against pathogenic strains. The whole-genome analysis provided unequivocal evidence in support of the huge potential of the strain BSXE-1601 to produce diverse biologically antagonistic natural products, which may facilitate further studies on the effective therapeutics for detrimental diseases in shrimp.">

One example, leubethanol from Texas sage (Leucophyllum frutescens) has demonstrated activity against multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Leubethanol is the only serrulatane diterpenoid identified from this genus; however, a range of such compounds have been found throughout the closely related Eremophila genus. Despite their potential therapeutic relevance, the biosynthesis of serrulatane diterpenoids has not been previously reported. Here we leverage the simple product profile and high accumulation of leubethanol in the roots of L.Â frutescens and compare tissue-specific transcriptomes with existing data from Eremophila serrulata to decipher the biosynthesis of leubethanol. A short-chain cis-prenyl transferase (LfCPT1) first produces the rare diterpene precursor nerylneryl diphosphate, which is cyclized by an unusual plastidial terpene synthase (LfTPS1) into the characteristic serrulatane diterpene backbone. Final conversion to leubethanol is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 (CYP71D616) of the CYP71 clan. This pathway documents the presence of a short-chain cis-prenyl diphosphate synthase, previously only found in Solanaceae, which is likely involved in the biosynthesis of other known diterpene backbones in Eremophila. LfTPS1 represents neofunctionalization of a compartment-switching terpene synthase accepting a novel substrate in the plastid. Biosynthetic access to leubethanol will enable pathway discovery to more complex serrulatane diterpenoids which share this common starting structure and provide a platform for the production and diversification of this class of promising anti-microbial therapeutics in heterologous systems.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;In an effort to ensure future energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create domestic jobs, the US has invested in technologies to develop sustainable biofuels and bioproducts from renewable carbon sources such as lignocellulosic biomass. Bio-derived jet fuel is of particular interest as aviation is less amenable to electrification compared to other modes of transportation and synthetic biology provides the ability to tailor fuel properties to enhance performance. Specific energy and energy density are important properties in determining the attractiveness of potential bio-derived jet fuels. For example, increased energy content can give the industry options such as longer range, higher load or reduced takeoff weight. Energy-dense sesquiterpenes have been identified as potential next-generation jet fuels that can be renewably produced from lignocellulosic biomass.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We developed a biomass deconstruction and conversion process that enabled the production of two tricyclic sesquiterpenes, epi-isozizaene and prespatane, from the woody biomass poplar using the versatile basidiomycete Rhodosporidium toruloides. We demonstrated terpene production at both bench and bioreactor scales, with prespatane titers reaching 1173.6Â mg/L when grown in poplar hydrolysate in a 2 L bioreactor. Additionally, we examined the theoretical fuel properties of prespatane and epi-isozizaene in their hydrogenated states as blending options for jet fuel, and compared them to aviation fuel, Jet A.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings indicate that prespatane and epi-isozizaene in their hydrogenated states would be attractive blending options in Jet A or other lower density renewable jet fuels as they would improve viscosity and increase their energy density. Saturated epi-isozizaene and saturated prespatane have energy densities that are 16.6 and 18.8% higher than Jet A, respectively. These results highlight the potential of R. toruloides as a production host for the sustainable and scalable production of bio-derived jet fuel blends, and this is the first report of prespatane as an alternative jet fuel.">

        <span class="abst" title="The rapid assignment of genotypes to phenotypes has been a historically challenging process. The discovery of genes encoding biosynthetic pathway enzymes for defined plant specialized metabolites has been informed and accelerated by the detection of gene clusters. Unfortunately, biosynthetic pathway genes are commonly dispersed across chromosomes or reside in genes clusters that provide little predictive value. More reliably, transcript abundance of genes underlying biochemical pathways for plant specialized metabolites display significant coregulation. By rapidly identifying highly coexpressed transcripts, it is possible to efficiently narrow candidate genes encoding pathway enzymes and more easily predict both functions and functional associations. Mutual Rank (MR)-based coexpression analyses in plants accurately demonstrate functional associations for many specialized metabolic pathways; however, despite the clear predictive value of MR analyses, the application is uncommonly used to drive new pathway discoveries. Moreover, many coexpression databases aid in the prediction of both functional associations and gene functions, but lack customizability for refined hypothesis testing. To facilitate and speed flexible MR-based hypothesis testing, we developed MutRank, an R Shiny web-application for coexpression analyses. MutRank provides an intuitive graphical user interface with multiple customizable features that integrates user-provided data and supporting information suitable for personal computers. Tabular and graphical outputs facilitate the rapid analyses of both unbiased and user-defined coexpression results that accelerate gene function predictions. We highlight the recent utility of MR analyses for functional predictions and discoveries in defining two maize terpenoid antibiotic pathways. Beyond applications in biosynthetic pathway discovery, MutRank provides a simple, customizable and user-friendly interface to enable coexpression analyses relating to a breadth of plant biology inquiries.

The development of alternative advanced liquid fuels is critical to sustainable development within the sector. Such fuels should be compatible with existing infrastructure and derived from second generation feedstocks to avoid competition with food markets. With properties similar to petroleum based fuels, isoprenoid derived compounds such as limonene, bisabolane, farnesane, and pinene dimers are of increasing interest as &quot;drop-in&quot; replacement jet fuels. In this review potential isoprenoid derived jet fuels and progress toward their microbial production was discussed in detail. Although substantial advancements have been achieved, the use of first generation feedstocks remains ubiquitous. Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant raw material available for biofuel production, however, technological constraints associated with its pretreatment and saccharification hinder its economic feasibility for low-value commodity production. Non-conventional microbes with novel characteristics including cellulolytic bacteria and fungi capable of highly efficient lignocellulose degradation and xylose fermenting oleaginous yeast with enhanced lignin-associated inhibitor tolerance were investigated as alternatives to traditional model hosts. Finally, innovative bioprocessing methods including consolidated bioprocessing and sequential bioreactor approaches, with potential to capitalize on such unique natural capabilities were considered.">

Although the autoregulator synthase is thought to activate antibiotic production, the activation pathway remains poorly understood. &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces cyaneogriseus&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;noncyanogenus&lt;/i&gt; NMWT1 produces nemadectin, which is widely used as a biopesticide and veterinary drug due to its potent nematocidal activity. Here, we identified the Aco/ArpA-like system ScyA1/ScyR1, the ArpA homolog ScyR2 and the AfsA/ArpA-like system ScyA3/ScyR3 as important regulators of nemadectin production in NMWT1. Genetic experiments revealed that these five genes positively regulate nemadectin production, with &lt;i&gt;scyA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;scyR1&lt;/i&gt; having the most potent effects. Importantly, ScyA1 is an upstream regulator of &lt;i&gt;scyR1&lt;/i&gt; and promotes nemadectin production and sporulation by activating &lt;i&gt;scyR1&lt;/i&gt; transcription. Intriguingly, &lt;i&gt;scyR1&lt;/i&gt; silencing in NMWT1 up-regulated 12 of the 17 secondary metabolite biosynthetic core genes present in the NMWT1 genome, suggesting that ScyR1 mainly to be a repressor of secondary metabolism. In conclusion, our findings unveiled the regulatory pathways adopted by the quorum-sensing system, and provided the basis for a method to enhance antibiotic production and to activate the expression of cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters.">

        <span class="abst" title="Akkermansia muciniphila is a prominent member of the gut microbiota and the organism gets exposed to bile acids within this niche. Several gut bacteria have bile response genes to metabolize bile acids or an ability to change their membrane structure to prevent membrane damage from bile acids. To understand the response to bile acids and how A. muciniphila can persist in the gut, we studied the effect of bile acids and individual bile salts on growth. In addition, the change in gene expression under ox-bile condition was studied. The growth of A. muciniphila was inhibited by ox-bile and the bile salts mixture. Individual bile salts have differential effects on the growth. Although most bile salts inhibited the growth of A. muciniphila, an increased growth was observed under culture conditions with sodium deoxycholate. Zaragozic acid A, which is a squalene synthase inhibitor leading to changes in the membrane structure, increased the susceptibility of A. muciniphila to bile acids. Transcriptome analysis showed that gene clusters associated with an ABC transporter and RND transporter were upregulated in the presence of ox-bile. In contrast, a gene cluster containing a potassium transporter was downregulated. Membrane transporter inhibitors also decreased the tolerance to bile acids of A. muciniphila. Our results indicated that membrane transporters and the squalene-associated membrane structure could be major bile response systems required for bile tolerance in A. muciniphila. KEY POINTS: â€¢ The growth of Akkermansia muciniphila was inhibited by most bile salts. â€¢ Sodium deoxycholate increased the growth of A. muciniphila. â€¢ The genes encoding transporters and hopanoid synthesis were upregulated by ox-bile. â€¢ The inhibitors of transporters and hopanoid synthesis reduced ox-bile tolerance.">

        <span class="abst" title="Changing environmental conditions are of utmost importance for regulation of secondary metabolism in fungi. Different environmental cues including the carbon source, light and the presence of a mating partner can lead to altered production of compounds. Thereby, the heterotrimeric G-protein pathway is of major importance for sensing and adjustment of gene regulation. Regulation of secondary metabolism is crucial in the biotechnological workhorse &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma reesei&lt;/i&gt; for knowledge-based adjustment in industrial fermentations, but also with respect to the potential use as a host for heterologous compound production. We investigated the function of the class VII G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) gene &lt;i&gt;gpr8&lt;/i&gt; that is localized in the vicinity of the SOR cluster, which is responsible for biosynthesis of sorbicillinoids. GPR8 positively impacts regulation of the genes in this cluster in darkness. Accordingly, abundance of trichodimerol and dihydrotrichotetronine as well as other secondary metabolites is decreased in the deletion mutant. Transcriptome analysis moreover showed the major role of GPR8 being exerted in darkness with a considerable influence on regulation of secondary metabolism. Genes regulated in Î”&lt;i&gt;gpr8&lt;/i&gt; overlap with those regulated directly or indirectly by the transcription factor YPR2, especially concerning genes related to secondary metabolism. The predicted FAD/FMN containing dehydrogenase gene &lt;i&gt;sor7&lt;/i&gt;, one of the positive targets of the cascade triggered by GPR8, has a positive effect on secondary metabolite production, but also cellulase gene expression. Hence SOR7 has some overlapping, but also additional functions compared to GPR8. The G-protein coupled receptor GPR8 exerts a light dependent impact on secondary metabolism, which is in part mediated by the transcription factor YPR2 and the function of SOR7. Hence, &lt;i&gt;T. reesei&lt;/i&gt; may apply GPR8 to adjust production of secondary metabolites and hence chemical communication to signals from the environment.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The characteristics of elephant grass, especially its stem lignocellulose, are of great significance for its quality as feed or other industrial raw materials. However, the research on lignocellulose biosynthesis pathway and key genes is limited because the genome of elephant grass has not been deciphered.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) combined with lignocellulose content analysis and cell wall morphology observation using elephant grass stems from different development stages as materials were applied to reveal the genes that regulate the synthesis of cellulose and lignin. A total of 3852 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in three periods of T1, T2, and T3 through RNA-seq analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of all DEGs showed that the two most abundant metabolic pathways were phenylpropane metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, which were closely related to cell wall development, hemicellulose, lignin and cellulose synthesis. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of DEGs, a 'blue' module highly associated with cellulose synthesis and a 'turquoise' module highly correlated with lignin synthesis were exhibited. A total of 43 candidate genes were screened, of which 17 had function annotations in other species. Besides, by analyzing the content of lignocellulose in the stem tissues of elephant grass at different developmental stages and the expression levels of genes such as CesA, PAL, CAD, C4H, COMT, CCoAMT, F5H and CCR, it was found that the content of lignocellulose was related to the expression level of these structural genes.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study provides a basis for further understanding the molecular mechanisms of cellulose and lignin synthesis pathways of elephant grass, and offers a unique and extensive list of candidate genes for future specialized functional studies which may promote the development of high-quality elephant grass varieties with high cellulose and low lignin content.">

However, these compounds often occur at low concentrations in uncultivated species. Producing phytochemicals in heterologous systems has the potential to address the bioavailability issues related to obtaining these molecules from their natural source. Plants are suitable heterologous systems for the production of valuable phytochemicals as they are autotrophic, derive energy and carbon from photosynthesis, and have similar cellular context to native producer plants. In this review we highlight the methods that are used to elucidate natural product biosynthetic pathways, including the approaches leading to proposing the sequence of enzymatic steps, selecting enzyme candidates and characterizing gene function. We will also discuss the advantages of using plant chasses as production platforms for high value phytochemicals. In addition, through this report we will assess the emerging metabolic engineering strategies that have been developed to enhance and optimize the production of natural and novel bioactive phytochemicals in heterologous plant systems.">

In this study a sesquiterpene cyclase from Trichoderma spp. is described that can convert farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) directly via a remarkable skeletal rearrangement into trichobrasilenol, a new brasilane sesquiterpene with one additional Me group equivalent compared to FPP.

Although the essential oils obtained from &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt; have been widely used in pharmaceutical, medicinal, perfume, and food industries, the molecular mechanisms underlying terpenoid biosynthesis are poorly understood. To address this lack of knowledge, we performed transcriptome analysis to investigate the key regulatory genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;. High-oil-yield trees of linalool type and low-oil-yield trees were used to assemble a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 121,285 unigenes were assembled, and the total length, average length, N50, and GC content of unigenes were 87,869,987, 724, 1,063, and 41.1%, respectively. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of linalool-type &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt; with trees of low oil yield resulted in a total of 3,689 differentially expressed unigenes, among them 31 candidate genes had annotations associated with metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, including four in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway and three in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. Collectively, this genome-wide transcriptome provides a valuable tool for future identification of genes related to essential oil biosynthesis. Additionally, the identification of a cohort of genes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids provides a theoretical basis for metabolic engineering of essential oils in &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;.">

Recent studies provided evidence for protective roles of BCP in animal cells, highlighting its possible use as a novel therapeutic tool. Experimental results show the ability of BCP to reduce pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB), thus ameliorating chronic pathologies characterized by inflammation and oxidative stress, in particular metabolic and neurological diseases. Through the binding to CB2 cannabinoid receptors and the interaction with members of the family of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), BCP shows beneficial effects on obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) liver diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, pain and other nervous system disorders. This review describes the current knowledge on the biosynthesis and natural sources of BCP, and reviews its role and mechanisms of action in different inflammation-related metabolic and neurologic disorders.">

        <span class="abst" title="Prostatitis is an inflammatory condition that is related to multiple infectious agents, including bacteria and fungi. Traditional herbal extracts proved efficacious in controlling clinical symptoms associated with prostatitis. In this context, the aim of the present study was to explore the efficacy of extracts from &lt;i&gt;Solidago virga-aurea&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ononis spinosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Peumus boldus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Epilobium angustifolium,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Phyllanthus niruri&lt;/i&gt; against bacterial (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;) and fungi strains (&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans; C. tropicalis&lt;/i&gt;) involved in prostatitis. Additionally, anti-mycotic effects were tested against multiple species of dermatophytes (&lt;i&gt;Trichophyton rubrum, T. tonsurans, T. erinacei, Arthroderma crocatum, A. quadrifidum, A. gypseum, A. currey&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;A. insingulare&lt;/i&gt;). Antioxidant effects were also evaluated in isolated rat prostates challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and phytochemical analyses were conducted to identify and quantify selected phenolic compounds, in the extracts. Finally, a bioinformatics analysis was conducted to predict putative human and microbial enzymes targeted by extracts' phytocompounds and underlying the observed bio-pharmacological effects. The phytochemical analysis highlighted that rutin levels could be crucial for explaining the highest antibacterial activity of &lt;i&gt;P. boldus&lt;/i&gt; extract, especially against &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt;. On the other hand, in the &lt;i&gt;E. angustifolium&lt;/i&gt; extract, catechin concentration could partially explain the highest efficacy of this extract in reducing lipid peroxidation, in isolated rat prostates stimulated with LPS. Concluding, the results of the present study showed moderate antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects induced by water extracts of &lt;i&gt;S. virga-aurea, P. boldus, E. angustifolium, P. niruri&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;O. spinosa&lt;/i&gt; that could be related, at least partially, to the phenolic composition of the phytocomplex.">

However, biosynthesis of mono- and sesquiterpenoids in Stevia remains unknown. Here we analyzed the extracts of Stevia leaves, flowers, stems, and roots by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and putatively identified a total of 69 volatile organic compounds, most of which were terpenoids with considerably varied quantities among the four tissues of Stevia. Using Stevia transcriptomes, we identified and functionally characterized five terpene synthases (TPSs) that produced major mono- and sesquiterpenoids in Stevia. Transcript levels of these Stevia &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt;s and levels of corresponding terpenoids correlated well in Stevia tissues. Particularly, the root-specific SrTPS4 and SrTPS5 catalyzed the formation of Î³-curcumene/zingiberene/Î²-sesquiphellandrene and Î±-longipinene/Î²-himachalene/himachalol as multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, respectively. Most of the &lt;i&gt;SrTPSs&lt;/i&gt; were highly responsive to various environmental stresses in a tissue-specific manner. Taken together, our results provide new insights into how Stevia produces diverse terpenoids to confer differential responses to various environmental factors in each tissue.">

The relative scent intensity of &quot;Shiny Gold&quot; was approximately 16% higher in full-bloomed flower when compared to the yellow bud stage, while tissue-specifically, tepals showed higher intensity in electronic-nose (e-nose) analysis. E-nose analysis also showed that the scent intensity of &quot;Shiny Gold&quot; was higher and lower than &quot;10C3-424&quot; and &quot;10C3-894&quot;, respectively, and was similar to &quot;Yvonne&quot;. These results correlated to those of the olfactory tests. In total, 19 volatile compounds, including linalool, Î²-ocimene, D-limonene, trans-Î²-ionone were detected in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Among these, linalool was the major volatile compound, accounting for 38.7% in &quot;Shiny Gold&quot;. Linalool synthase and &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; gene expression corresponded to the scent intensity of the four cultivars, with the lowest expression in the &quot;10C3-424&quot;. &lt;i&gt;TPS 2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPS 3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPS 5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPS 6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TPS 8&lt;/i&gt; were highly expressed in both bud and flower in &quot;Shiny Gold&quot;, while the expression of &lt;i&gt;TPS 4&lt;/i&gt; was lower, relative to other &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes in both the flowering stages.

The plant Curcuma wenyujin, which is grown primarily in Wenzhou, China, is considered the best source of Rhizoma Curcumae. In this study, we sought to ascertain differences in transcript profiles of C. wenyujin grown in traditional (Wenzhou) and recently established (Haikou) production areas based on Illumina and RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing. We also examined differences in the main components of the volatile oil terpene; curcumin, polysaccharide, and starch constituents and related genes in the corresponding pathways, in C. wenyujin cultivated in the two production areas. We accordingly found that the essential oil (2.05%), curcumin (1.46%), and polysaccharide (8.90%) content in Wenzhou rhizomes was higher than that in the rhizomes of plants from Haikou (1.60%, 0.91%, and 6.15%, respectively). In contrast, the starch content of Wenzhou rhizomes (17.0%) was lower than that of Haikou rhizomes (23.8%). Furthermore, we detected significant differences in the oil components of Haikou and Wenzhou rhizomes, with curzerene (32.34%), curdione (21.35%), and germacrene B (9.39%) being the primary components of the essential oil derived from Wenzhou rhizomes, and curzerene (20.13%), curdione (14.73%), and cineole (9.76%) being the main constituents in Haikou rhizomes. Transcriptome and qPCR analyses revealed considerable differences in gene expression between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes. The expression of terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide pathway-related genes in Wenzhou rhizomes was significantly up-regulated, whereas the expression of starch-associated genes was significantly down-regulated, compared with those in Haikou rhizomes. Difference in the content of terpene, curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch in rhizomes from the two production areas could be explained in terms of differences in expression of the related genes.">

The present study investigates a carrot terpene synthase gene cluster on chromosome 4 associated with volatile monoterpene production. Two carrot mutants, yellow and cola, which are contrasting in the content of low molecular weight terpenes, were crossed to develop an F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mapping population. The mapping analysis revealed overlapping QTLs on chromosome 4 for sabinene, Î±-thujene, Î±-terpinene, Î³-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol and 4-carene. The genomic region of this locus includes a cluster of five terpene synthase genes (DcTPS04, DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54 and DcTPS55). DcTPS04 and DcTPS54 displayed genotype- and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Based on the QTL mapping results and the gene expression patterns, DcTPS04 and DcTPS54 were selected for functional characterization. In vitro enzyme assays showed that DcTPS54 is a single-product enzyme catalysing the formation of sabinene, whereas DcTPS04 is a multiple-product terpene synthase producing Î±-terpineol as a major product and four additional products including sabinene, Î²-limonene, Î²-pinene and myrcene. Furthermore, we developed a functional molecular marker that could discriminate carrot genotypes with different sabinene content in a set of 85 accessions.">

Moreover, integrative analysis of the metabolomes and transcriptomes revealed that the flavonoid pathway contained the upregulated DEM (-)-epicatechin. Fourteen DEGs from the photosynthesis pathway were positively or negatively correlated with the DEMs.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings suggest a complex metabolic network in mutant yellow leaves.

Currently, GA is mainly extracted from the roots of cultivated licorice. However, licorice only contains low amounts of GA, and the amount of licorice that can be planted is limited. GA supplies are therefore limited and cannot meet the demands of growing markets. GA has a complex chemical structure, and its chemical synthesis is difficult, therefore, new strategies to produce large amounts of GA are needed. The development of metabolic engineering and emerging synthetic biology provide the opportunity to produce GA using microbial cell factories. In this review, current advances in the metabolic engineering of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; for GA biosynthesis and various metabolic engineering strategies that can improve GA production are summarized. Furthermore, the advances and challenges of yeast GA production are also discussed. In summary, GA biosynthesis using metabolically engineered &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; serves as one possible strategy for sustainable GA supply and reasonable use of traditional Chinese medical plants.">

Much attention has been paid to the effective prevention and treatment of neuroprotective drugs by natural products. This review summarizes the neuroprotective aspects of natural products, extracted from Panax ginseng, Camellia sinensis, soy and some other plants, and some of their chemical derivatives. Their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory action and their inhibition of apoptosis and microglial activation are assessed. This will provide new directions for the development of novel drugs and strategies to treat neurodegenerative diseases.">

In silico differential gene expression analysis created an overview of patterns of gene expression during exposure to drought and salt stress. Separate gene expression profiles for leaf and root tissue revealed the differences in regulatory mechanisms operating in these tissues during exposure to abiotic stress. Several transcription factors were identified and studied for differential expression. 61 differentially expressed genes were found to be common to both tissues under drought and salinity stress and were further validated using qRT-PCR. Transcriptome of P. sumatrense was also used to mine for genic SSR markers relevant to abiotic stress tolerance. This study is first report on a detailed analysis of molecular mechanisms of drought and salinity stress tolerance in a little millet variety.

Native hosts have evolved to accumulate large quantities of terpenes in specialized cells. However, heterologous cells lack the capacity needed to produce and store high amounts of non-native terpenes, leading to reduced growth and loss of volatile terpenes by evaporation. Here, we describe how to direct the sesquiterpene patchoulol production into cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) in Physcomitrium patens (syn. Physcomitrella patens), by attaching patchoulol synthase (PTS) to proteins linked to plant LD biogenesis. Three different LD-proteins: Oleosin (PpOLE1), Lipid Droplet Associated Protein (AtLDAP1) and Seipin (PpSeipin325) were tested as anchors. Ectopic expression of PTS increased the number and size of LDs, implying an unknown mechanism between heterologous terpene production and LD biogenesis. The expression of PTS physically linked to Seipin increased the LD size and the retention of patchoulol in the cell. Overall, the expression of PTS was lower in the anchored mutants than in the control, but when normalized to the expression the production of patchoulol was higher in the seipin-linked mutants.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Tansy plants (Tanacetum vulgare L.) are known for their high intraspecific chemical variation, especially of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from the terpenoid compound group. These VOCs are closely involved in plant-insect interactions and, when profiled, can be used to classify plants into groups known as chemotypes. Tansy chemotypes have been shown to influence plant-aphid interactions, however, to date no information is available on the response of different tansy chemotypes to simultaneous herbivory by more than one insect species.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Using a multi-cuvette system, we investigated the responses of five tansy chemotypes to feeding by sucking and/or chewing herbivores (aphids and caterpillars; Metopeurum fuscoviride Stroyan and Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval). Herbivory by caterpillars following aphid infestation led to a plant chemotype-specific change in the patterns of terpenoids stored in trichome hairs and in VOC emissions. The transcriptomic analysis of a plant chemotype represents the first de novo assembly of a transcriptome in tansy and demonstrates priming effects of aphids on a subsequent herbivory. Overall, we show that the five chemotypes do not react in the same way to the two herbivores. As expected, we found that caterpillar feeding increased VOC emissions, however, a priori aphid infestation only led to a further increase in VOC emissions for some chemotypes.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We were able to show that different chemotypes respond to the double herbivore attack in different ways, and that pre-treatment with aphids had a priming effect on plants when they were subsequently exposed to a chewing herbivore. If neighbouring chemotypes in a field population react differently to herbivory/dual herbivory, this could possibly have effects from the individual level to the group level. Individuals of some chemotypes may respond more efficiently to herbivory stress than others, and in a group environment these &quot;louder&quot; chemotypes may affect the local insect community, including the natural enemies of herbivores, and other neighbouring plants.">

Through our Diels-Alderase project in 1990s, we recognized a highly efficient expression system of various biosynthetic genes with Aspergillus oryzae as a host. With the development of tools such as genomic data and bioinformatics analysis to identify biosynthetic gene clusters for natural products, we developed a highly reliable methodology such as hot spot knock-in to elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of representative fungal metabolites including phytotoxic substances. This methodology allows total biosynthesis of natural products and genome mining using silent biosynthetic gene clusters to obtain novel bioactive metabolites.

However, why nature selects this C10-geranyl group remains a question. We conduct synthesis, UV-thermal denaturation, and molecular simulation studies in RNA duplexes and reveal possible reasons behind this natural selection. Among methyl-(C1), dimethylallyl-(C5), geranyl-(C10), and farnesyl-(C15) modified 2-thiouridines, only geranyl-group promotes U:G over U:A pair. Molecular simulation shows all the modified terpene groups point to the minor groove of RNA duplexes. The discrimination between U:G and U:A pairs derives from the difference in hydrogen bonding and interactions of the chain with the hydrophobic area in the minor groove. Geranyl group has perfect length to discriminate U:G and U:A pairs, whereas the others are either too long or too short to achieve the same behavior. This work indicates that geranyl group cannot be replaced by other terpene groups in promoting codon-specificity.">

Additionally, several residues in &quot;three floors&quot; for the chain length and several essential domains for enzymatic activities specifically varied in rice, potentiating evolutionarily rice-specific biochemical functions of twelve &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-PTs. Moreover, expression profiling and localization patterns revealed their functional compartmentation in rice. Taken together, we propose the predicted topology-based working model of rice PTs with corresponding terpene metabolites: GPP/GGPPs mainly in plastoglobuli, SPPs in stroma, PPPs in cytosol, mitochondria and chloroplast and FPPs in cytosol.

Floral VOCs are often involved in defense and pollinator attraction. These interactions often change rapidly over time, so a quick response to those changes is required. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which regulate both genes and transcription factors, might trigger adaptive responses to these evolutionary pressures as well as regulating the rhythmic emission of VOCs through circadian clock regulation. In addition, transgenerational epigenetic effects and whole genome polyploidy could modify the generation of VOCs' profiles of offspring, contributing to long-term evolutionary shifts. In this article, we review the available knowledge about the mechanisms that may act as epigenetic regulators of the main VOC biosynthetic pathways, and their importance in plant evolution.">

        <span class="abst" title="Brown rot fungi have great potential in biorefinery wood conversion systems because they are the primary wood decomposers in coniferous forests and have an efficient lignocellulose degrading system. Their initial wood degradation mechanism is thought to consist of an oxidative radical-based system that acts sequentially with an enzymatic saccharification system, but the complete molecular mechanism of this system has not yet been elucidated. Some studies have shown that wood degradation mechanisms of brown rot fungi have diversity in their substrate selectivity. Gloeophyllum trabeum, one of the most studied brown rot species, has broad substrate selectivity and even can degrade some grasses. However, the basis for this broad substrate specificity is poorly understood. In this study, we performed RNA-seq analyses on G. trabeum grown on media containing glucose, cellulose, or Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) as the sole carbon source. Comparison to the gene expression on glucose, 1,129 genes were upregulated on cellulose and 1,516 genes were upregulated on cedar. Carbohydrate Active enZyme (CAZyme) genes upregulated on cellulose and cedar media by G. trabeum included glycoside hyrolase family 12 (GH12), GH131, carbohydrate esterase family 1 (CE1), auxiliary activities family 3 subfamily 1 (AA3_1), AA3_2, AA3_4 and AA9, which is a newly reported expression pattern for brown rot fungi. The upregulation of both terpene synthase and cytochrome P450 genes on cedar media suggests the potential importance of these gene products in the production of secondary metabolites associated with the chelator-mediated Fenton reaction. These results provide new insights into the inherent wood degradation mechanism of G. trabeum and the diversity of brown rot mechanisms.">

Monoterpenoids are the main components of plant essential oils and the active components of some traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. Some monoterpenoids are widely used in medicine, cosmetics and other industries, and they are mainly obtained by plant biomass extraction methods. These plant extraction methods have some problems, such as low efficiency, unstable quality, and high cost. Moreover, the monoterpenoid production from plant cannot satisfy the growing monoterpenoids demand. The development of metabolic engineering, protein engineering and synthetic biology provides an opportunity to produce large amounts of monoterpenoids eco-friendly using microbial cell factories. This mini-review covers current monoterpenoids production using &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. The monoterpenoids biosynthetic pathways, engineering of key monoterpenoids biosynthetic enzymes, and current monoterpenoids production using &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; were summarized.

The whole-genome sequence of strain YB-130 was obtained by PacBio sequencing. 88 putative Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes and 12 gene clusters encoding for secondary metabolites were identified in the YB-130 genome, including one gene cluster for the synthesis of lanthipeptide only found in strain YB-130 genome.

Furthermore, strain YB-130 was able to significantly inhibit spore morphology and hyphal development of &lt;i&gt;F. graminearum&lt;/i&gt; PH-1. Strain YB-130 also reduced deoxynivalenol production by &lt;i&gt;F. graminearum&lt;/i&gt; PH-1 in dual cultures, possibly due to its ability to suppress the expression of &lt;i&gt;tri5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tri3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;tri8&lt;/i&gt; that are required for deoxynivalenol production in &lt;i&gt;F. graminearum&lt;/i&gt;.

        <span class="abst" title="Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide health crisis for which new antibiotics are needed. One strategy for antibiotic discovery is identifying unique antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters that may produce novel compounds. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how an integrated approach that combines genome mining, comparative genomics, and functional genetics can be used to successfully identify novel biosynthetic gene clusters that produce antimicrobial natural products. Secondary metabolite clusters of an antibiotic producer are first predicted using genome mining tools, generating a list of candidates. Comparative genomic approaches are then used to identify gene suites present in the antibiotic producer that are absent in closely related non-producers. Gene sets that are common to the two lists represent leading candidates, which can then be confirmed using functional genetics approaches. To validate this strategy, we identified the genes responsible for antibiotic production in &lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; B025670, a strain identified in a large-scale bioactivity survey. The genome of B025670 was first mined with antiSMASH, which identified 24 candidate regions. We then used the comparative genomics platform, EDGAR, to identify genes unique to B025670 that were not present in closely related strains with contrasting antibiotic production profiles. The candidate lists generated by antiSMASH and EDGAR were compared with standalone BLAST. Among the common regions was a 14 kb cluster consisting of 14 genes with predicted enzymatic, transport, and unknown functions. Site-directed mutagenesis of the gene cluster resulted in a reduction in antimicrobial activity, suggesting involvement in antibiotic production. An integrated approach that combines genome mining, comparative genomics, and functional genetics yields a powerful, yet simple strategy for identifying potentially novel antibiotics.">

        <span class="abst" title="Class I terpene synthase (TPS) generates bioactive terpenoids with diverse backbones. Sesterterpene synthase (sester-TPS, C25), a branch of class I TPSs, was recently identified in Brassicaceae. However, the catalytic mechanisms of sester-TPSs are not fully understood. Here, we first identified three nonclustered functional sester-TPSs (AtTPS06, AtTPS22, and AtTPS29) in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. AtTPS06 utilizes a type-B cyclization mechanism, whereas most other sester-TPSs produce various sesterterpene backbones via a type-A cyclization mechanism. We then determined the crystal structure of the AtTPS18-FSPP complex to explore the cyclization mechanism of plant sester-TPSs. We usedÂ structural comparisons and site-directed mutagenesis to further elucidate the mechanism: (1) mainly due to the outward shift of helix G, plant sester-TPSs have a larger catalytic pocket than do mono-, sesqui-, and di-TPSs to accommodate GFPP; (2) type-A sester-TPSs have more aromatic residues (five or six) in their catalytic pocket than classic TPSs (two or three), which also determines whether the type-A or type-B cyclization mechanism is active; and (3) the other residues responsible for product fidelity are determined by interconversion of AtTPS18 and its close homologs. Altogether, this study improves our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of plant sester-TPS, which ultimately enables the rational engineering of sesterterpenoids for future applications.">

The overall GC content of &lt;i&gt;C. brevistyla&lt;/i&gt; cp genome is 37.19%, with the base content A (31.03%), T (31.78%), C (18.94%), and G (18.25%). Phylogenetic analysis of 20 species based on 74 protein-coding genes shows that &lt;i&gt;C. brevistyla&lt;/i&gt; is evolutionarily closest to &lt;i&gt;Camellia danzaiensis&lt;/i&gt;.">

Its molecular mechanism of biocontrol activity and the biosynthetic pathways involved have not been yet elucidated. Here, global transcriptome profiling of &lt;i&gt;C. globosum&lt;/i&gt; strain Cg2 during interaction with &lt;i&gt;B. sorokiniana&lt;/i&gt; isolate BS112 using RNA-seq was performed in order to gain insights into the potential mechanisms of antagonism. The Illumina HiSeq platform (2 Ã— 150 bp) yielded an average of 20-22 million reads with 50-58% GC. &lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; assembly generated 45,582 transcripts with 27,957 unigenes. Transcriptome analysis displayed distinct expression profiles in the interaction (Cg2-BS112), out of which 6,109 unique differentially expressed genes were present. The predominant transcripts classified as genes involved in &quot;catalytic activity&quot; constituted 45.06%, of which 10.02% were associated with &quot;hydrolytic activity&quot; (GO:0008152), and similarly, in the biological process, 29.18% of transcripts were involved in &quot;metabolic activity&quot; (GO:0004096 and GO:0006979). Heat map and cluster categorization suggested an increase in the expression levels of genes encoding secondary metabolites like polyketide synthase (GO:0009058), &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxymethyl glutathione dehydrogenase (GO:0006069), terpene cyclase (EC 4.2.3.-), aminotran_1_2 domain-containing protein (GO:0009058), and other hydrolytic CAZYmes such as the glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family (GH 13, GH 2, GH 31, and GH 81; GO:0005975), cellulase domain-containing protein, chitinases, Î²-1, 3-glucanases (GO:0004565), glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (GO:0052861), and proteases (GO:0004177). The obtained RNA-seq data were validated by RT-qPCR using 20 randomly chosen genes, showing consistency with the RNA-seq results. The present work is worldwide the first effort to unravel the biocontrol mechanism of &lt;i&gt;C. globosum&lt;/i&gt; against &lt;i&gt;B. sorokiniana&lt;/i&gt;. It generated a novel dataset for further studies and facilitated improvement of the gene annotation models in the &lt;i&gt;C. globosum&lt;/i&gt; draft genome.">

        <span class="abst" title="Industrial hemp (&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) is a diploid (2&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20), dioecious plant that is grown for fiber, seed, and oil. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in this crop because of its panoply of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other phenolic compounds. Specifically, hemp contains terpenophenolic compounds such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG), which act on cannabinoid receptors and positively regulate various human metabolic, immunological, and physiological functions. CBD and CBG have an effect on the cytokine metabolism, which has led to the examination of cannabinoids on the treatment of viral diseases, including COVID-19. Based on genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies, several synthetic pathways of hemp secondary metabolite production have been elucidated. Nevertheless, there are few reports on hemp metabolic engineering despite obvious impact on scientific and industrial sectors. In this article, recent status and current perspectives on hemp metabolic engineering are reviewed. Three distinct approaches to expedite phytochemical yield are discussed. Special emphasis has been placed on transgenic and transient gene delivery systems, which are critical for successful metabolic engineering of hemp. The advent of new tools in synthetic biology, particularly the CRISPR/Cas systems, enables environment-friendly metabolic engineering to increase the production of desirable hemp phytochemicals while eliminating the psychoactive compounds, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).">

        <span class="abst" title="Patchouli oil is a major ingredient in perfumery, granting a dark-woody scent due to its main constituent (-)-patchoulol. The growing demand for patchouli oil has raised interest in the development of a biotechnological process to assure a reliable supply. Herein, we report the production of patchouli oil sesquiterpenes by metabolically engineered &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains, using solid-liquid phase partitioning cultivation. The (-)-patchoulol production was possible using the endogenous methylerythritol phosphate pathway and overexpressing a (-)-patchoulol synthase isoform from &lt;i&gt;Pogostemon cablin&lt;/i&gt; but at low titers. To improve the (-)-patchoulol production, the exogenous mevalonate pathway was overexpressed in the multi-plasmid PTS + Mev strain, which increased the (-)-patchoulol titer 5-fold. Fermentation was improved further by evaluating several defined media, and optimizing the pH and temperature of culture broth, enhancing the (-)-patchoulol titer 3-fold. To augment the (-)-patchoulol recovery from fermentation, the solid-liquid phase partitioning cultivation was analyzed by screening polymeric adsorbers, where the Diaion HP20 adsorber demonstrated the highest (-)-patchoulol recovery from all tests. Fermentation was scaled-up to fed-batch bioreactors, reaching a (-)-patchoulol titer of 40.2 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and productivity of 20.1 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The terpene profile and aroma produced from the PTS + Mev strain were similar to the patchouli oil, comprising (-)-patchoulol as the main product, and Î±-bulnesene, trans-Î²-caryophyllene, Î²-patchoulene, and guaia-5,11-diene as side products. This investigation represents the first study of (-)-patchoulol production in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; by solid-liquid phase partitioning cultivation, which provides new insights for the development of sustainable bioprocesses for the microbial production of fragrant terpenes.">

However, the shortage of understanding of cyanobacterial metabolic and regulatory networks for atmospheric carbon fixation to biochemical production and the lack of available engineering tools limit the potential of cyanobacteria for industrial applications. Recently, to overcome the limitations, synthetic biology tools and systems biology approaches such as genome-scale modeling based on diverse omics data have been applied to cyanobacteria.

Escovopsis weberi produces the shearinine terpene-indole alkaloids, which affect ant behaviour, diketopiperazines to combat defensive bacteria, and other small molecules that inhibit the fungal cultivar. Pseudonocardia and Streptomyces mutualist bacteria produce depsipeptide and polyene macrolide antifungals active against Escovopsis spp. The ant nest metabolome is further complicated by competition between defensive bacteria, which produce antibacterials active against even closely related species.">

Especially in the field of antibiotics, Actinobacteria have been proven to be a reliable source for lead structures. The discovery of these natural products with activity- and structure-guided screenings has been impeded by the constant rediscovery of previously identified compounds. Additionally, a large discrepancy between produced natural products and biosynthetic potential in Actinobacteria, including representatives of the order &lt;i&gt;Pseudonocardiales&lt;/i&gt;, has been revealed using genome sequencing. To turn this genomic potential into novel natural products, we used an approach including the in-silico pre-selection of unique biosynthetic gene clusters followed by their systematic heterologous expression. As a proof of concept, fifteen &lt;i&gt;Saccharothrix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;espanaensis&lt;/i&gt; genomic library clones covering predicted biosynthetic gene clusters were chosen for expression in two heterologous hosts, &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;lividans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;albus&lt;/i&gt;. As a result, two novel natural products, an unusual angucyclinone pentangumycin and a new type II polyketide synthase shunt product SEK90, were identified. After purification and structure elucidation, the biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of pentangumycin and SEK90 were deduced using mutational analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster and feeding experiments with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labelled precursors.">

        <span class="abst" title="Melleolides and armillyl orsellinates are protoilludene-type aryl esters that are synthesized exclusively by parasitic fungi of the globally distributed genus Armillaria (Agaricomycetes, Physalacriaceae). Several of these compounds show potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, making them promising leads for the development of new antibiotics or drugs for the treatment of cancer. We recently cloned and characterized the Armillaria gallica gene Pro1 encoding protoilludene synthase, a sesquiterpene cyclase catalyzing the pathway-committing step to all protoilludene-type aryl esters. Fungal enzymes representing secondary metabolic pathways are sometimes encoded by gene clusters, so we hypothesized that the missing steps in the pathway to melleolides and armillyl orsellinates might be identified by cloning the genes surrounding Pro1. Here we report the isolation of an A. gallica gene cluster encoding protoilludene synthase and four cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Heterologous expression and functional analysis resulted in the identification of protoilludene-8Î±-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first committed step in the armillyl orsellinate pathway. This confirms that âˆ†-6-protoilludene is a precursor for the synthesis of both melleolides and armillyl orsellinates, but the two pathways already branch at the level of the first oxygenation step. Our results provide insight into the synthesis of these valuable natural products and pave the way for their production by metabolic engineering. KEY POINTS: â€¢ Protoilludene-type aryl esters are bioactive metabolites produced by Armillaria spp. â€¢ The pathway-committing step to these compounds is catalyzed by protoilludene synthase. â€¢ We characterized CYP-type enzymes in the cluster and identified novel intermediates.">

The novel genome editing techniques add new possibilities to study gene function and breed new varieties. The implementation of such techniques, however, relies on detailed information about structure and function of genomes and genes. Moreover, improved protocols for efficient delivery of editing reagents are required. Recent results of the application of genome editing techniques to elite ornamental crops are discussed in this review. Enabling technologies and genomic resources are reviewed in relation to the implementation of such approaches. Availability of the main gene sequences, underlying commercial traits and in vitro transformation protocols are provided for the world's best-selling cut flowers, namely rose, lily, chrysanthemum, lisianthus, tulip, gerbera, freesia, alstroemeria, carnation and hydrangea.

Genetically female Cannabis sativa plants normally bear female flowers, but can develop male flowers in response to environmental and developmental cues. In an attempt to elucidate the molecular elements responsible for sex expression in C. sativa plants, we developed genetically female lines producing both female and chemically-induced male flowers. Furthermore, we carried out RNA-Seq assays aimed at identifying differentially expressed genes responsible for male flower development in female plants. The results revealed over 10,500 differentially expressed genes, of which around 200 potentially control masculinization of female cannabis plants. These genes include transcription factors and other genes involved in male organ (i.e., anther and pollen) development, as well as genes involved in phytohormone signalling and male-biased phenotypes. The expressions of 15 of these genes were further validated by qPCR assay confirming similar expression patterns to that of RNA-Seq data. These genes would be useful for understanding predisposed plants producing flowers of both sex types in the same plant, and help breeders to regulate the masculinization of female plants through targeted breeding and plant biotechnology.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Main conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) identification, expression profiles, and construction of circRNA-parental gene relationships and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA networks indicate that circRNAs are involved in flag leaf senescence of rice. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of 3'-5' head-to-tail covalently closed non-coding RNAs which have been proved to play important roles in various biological processes. However, no systematic identification of circRNAs associated with leaf senescence in rice has been studied. In this study, a genome-wide high-throughput sequencing analysis was performed using rice flag leaves developing from normal to senescence. Here, a total of 6612 circRNAs were identified, among which, 113 circRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) during the leaf senescence process. Moreover, 4601 (69.59%) circRNAs were derived from the exons or introns of their parental genes, while 2110 (71%) of the parental genes produced only one circRNA. The sequence alignment analysis showed that hundreds of rice circRNAs were conserved among different plant species. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that parental genes of DE circRNAs were enriched in many biological processes closely related to leaf senescence. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), six continuously down-expressed circRNAs, 18 continuously up-expressed circRNAs and 15 turn-point high-expressed circRNAs were considered to be highly associated with leaf senescence. Additionally, a total of 17 senescence-associated circRNAs were predicted to have parental genes, in which, regulations of three circRNAs to their parental genes were validated by qRT-PCR. The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were also constructed. And a total of 11 senescence-associated circRNAs were predicted to act as miRNA sponges to regulate mRNAs, in which, regulation of two circRNAs to eight mRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR. It is discussed that senescence-associated circRNAs were involved in flag leaf senescence probably through mediating their parental genes and ceRNA networks, to participate in several well-studied senescence-associated processes, mainly including the processes of transcription, translation, and posttranslational modification (especially protein glycosylation), oxidation-reduction process, involvement of senescence-associated genes, hormone signaling pathway, proteolysis, and DNA damage repair. This study not only showed the systematic identification of circRNAs involved in leaf senescence of rice, but also laid a foundation for functional research on candidate circRNAs.">

Therefore, alternative microbial production methods are rapidly emerging as an attractive alternative to make (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol production more sustainable and environmentally friendly.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We engineered Escherichia coli to possess a heterologous mevalonate (MVA) pathway, including limonene synthase, P-cymene monoxygenase hydroxylase and P-cymene monoxygenase reductase for the production of (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol. The concentration of (R)-(+)-limonene (the monoterpene precursor to (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol) reached 45â€‰mg/L from glucose. Enhanced (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol production was therefore achieved. The strain produced (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol at a titer of 87â€‰mg/L and a yield of 1.5â€‰mg/g glucose in a 5â€‰L bioreactor fed batch system.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;These datas highlight the efficient production of (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol through the mevalonate pathway from glucose.

The microbial platform for germacrene A production was previously established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the germacrene A synthase (LTC2) of Lactuca sativa.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We evaluated the performance of LTC2 (LsGAS) as well as nine other identified or putative germacrene A synthases from different sources for the production of germacrene A. AvGAS, a synthase of Anabaena variabilis, was found to be the most efficient in germacrene A production in yeast. AvGAS expression alone in S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1D already resulted in a substantial production of germacrene A while LTC2 expression did not. Further metabolic engineering the yeast using known strategies including overexpression of tHMGR1 and repression of squalene synthesis pathway led to an 11-fold increase in germacrene A production. Site-directed mutagenesis of AvGAS revealed that while changes of several residues located within the active site cavity severely compromised germacrene A production, substitution of Phe23 located on the lateral surface with tryptophan or valine led to a 35.2% and 21.8% increase in germacrene A production, respectively. Finally, the highest production titer of germacrene A reached 309.8Â mg/L in shake-flask batch culture.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our study highlights the potential of applying bacterial sesquiterpene synthases with improved performance by mutagenesis engineering in producing germacrene A.">

        <span class="abst" title="Passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims) is an economically valuable fruit that is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Here, we report an ~1341.7â€‰Mb chromosome-scale genome assembly of passion fruit, with 98.91% (~1327.18â€‰Mb) of the assembly assigned to nine pseudochromosomes. The genome includes 23,171 protein-coding genes, and most of the assembled sequences are repetitive sequences, with long-terminal repeats (LTRs) being the most abundant. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that passion fruit diverged after Brassicaceae and before Euphorbiaceae. Ks analysis showed that two whole-genome duplication events occurred in passion fruit at 65 MYA and 12 MYA, which may have contributed to its large genome size. An integrated analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data showed that 'alpha-linolenic acid metabolism', 'metabolic pathways', and 'secondary metabolic pathways' were the main pathways involved in the synthesis of important volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in passion fruit, and this analysis identified some candidate genes, including GDP-fucose Transporter 1-like, Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 33, protein NETWORKED 4B isoform X1, and Golgin Subfamily A member 6-like protein 22. In addition, we identified 13 important gene families in fatty acid pathways and eight important gene families in terpene pathways. Gene family analysis showed that the ACX, ADH, ALDH, and HPL gene families, especially ACX13/14/15/20, ADH13/26/33, ALDH1/4/21, and HPL4/6, were the key genes for ester synthesis, while the TPS gene family, especially PeTPS2/3/4/24, was the key gene family for terpene synthesis. This work provides insights into genome evolution and flavor trait biology and offers valuable resources for the improved cultivation of passion fruit.">

However, the physicochemical properties of monoterpenes make difficult their conventional conversion into value-added aromas. Biocatalysis, either by using whole cells or enzymes, may overcome such drawbacks in terms of purity of the final product, ecological and economic constraints of the current catalysis processes or extraction from plant material. In particular, the ability of oxidative enzymes (e.g., oxygenases) to modify the monoterpene backbone, with high regio- and stereo-selectivity, is attractive for the production of &quot;natural&quot; aromas for the flavor and fragrances industries. We review the research efforts carried out in the molecular analysis of bacterial monoterpene catabolic pathways and biochemical characterization of the respective key oxidative enzymes, with particular focus on the most relevant precursors, Î²-pinene, limonene and Î²-myrcene. The presented overview of the current state of art demonstrates that the specialized enzymatic repertoires of monoterpene-catabolizing bacteria are expanding the toolbox towards the tailored and sustainable biotechnological production of values-added aroma compounds (e.g., isonovalal, Î±-terpineol, and carvone isomers) whose implementation must be supported by the current advances in systems biology and metabolic engineering approaches.">

The use of host resistance has been an effective, environmentally friendly and sustainable approach for controlling several agricultural pests. The exploitation of natural variations in crop wild relatives could yield pest-resistant crop varieties. In this study, we used a high-throughput transcriptome profiling approach to investigate the defense mechanisms of susceptible cultivated and tolerant wild pigeonpea genotypes against &lt;i&gt;H. armigera&lt;/i&gt; infestation. The wild genotype displayed elevated pest-induced gene expression, including the enhanced induction of phytohormone and calcium/calmodulin signaling, transcription factors, plant volatiles and secondary metabolite genes compared to the cultivated control. The biosynthetic and regulatory processes associated with flavonoids, terpenes and glucosinolate secondary metabolites showed higher accumulations in the wild genotype, suggesting the existence of distinct tolerance mechanisms. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying insect resistance in the wild pigeonpea genotype. This information highlights the indispensable role of crop wild relatives as a source of crucial genetic resources that could be important in devising strategies for crop improvement with enhanced pest resistance.">

We studied VOC production from above and belowground organs of the eight parents of the Multi-Parent Advanced Generation Intercross population (MAGIC) tomato population, which exhibits a high genetic variability, in order to obtain more insight into the variability of constitutive VOC emissions from tomato plants under stress-free conditions. Foliage emissions were composed of terpenes, the majority of which were also stored in the leaves. Foliage emissions were very low, partly light-dependent, and differed significantly among genotypes, both in quantity and quality. Soil with roots emitted VOCs at similar, though more variable, rates than foliage. Soil emissions were characterized by terpenes, oxygenated alkanes, and alkenes and phenolic compounds, only a few of which were found in root extracts at low concentrations. Correlation analyses revealed that several VOCs emitted from foliage or soil are jointly regulated and that above and belowground sources are partially interconnected. With respect to VOC monitoring in tomato crops, our results underline that genetic variability, light-dependent de-novo synthesis, and belowground sources are factors to be considered for successful use in crop monitoring.">

        <span class="abst" title="Agrocybe cylindracea, an edible mushroom, is widely cultivated for its abundance of nutrients and flavor, and many of its metabolites are reported to have beneficial roles, such as medicinal effects on tumors and chronical illnesses. However, the lack of genomic information has hindered further molecular studies on this fungus. Here, we present a genome assembly of A. cylindracea together with comparative genomics and pathway analyses of Agaricales species. The draft, generated from both next-generation sequencing (NGS) and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing platforms to overcome high genetic heterozygosity, is composed of a 56.5Â Mb sequence and 15,384 predicted genes. This mushroom possesses a complex reproductive system, including tetrapolar heterothallic and secondary homothallic mechanisms, and harbors several hydrolases and peptidases for gradual and effective degradation of various carbon sources. Our pathway analysis reveals complex processes involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and other active substances, including B vitamins, unsaturated fatty acids, and N-acetylglucosamine. RNA-seq data show that A. cylindracea stipes tend to synthesize carbohydrate for carbon sequestration and energy storage, whereas pilei are more active in carbon utilization and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. These results reflect diverse functions of the two anatomical structures of the fruiting body. Our comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic data, as well as preliminary comparative analyses, provide insights into the molecular details of the medicinal effects in terms of active compounds and nutrient components.">

Using these de novo assemblies, along with other previously published genomes from 11 Solanaceae species, we carried out comparative genomic analyses to provide insights on the genome evolution of D. stramonium within the Solanaceae family, and to elucidate adaptive genomic signatures to biotic and abiotic stresses in this plant. We also studied, in detail, the evolution of four genes of D. stramonium-Putrescine N-methyltransferase, Tropinone reductase I, Tropinone reductase II and Hyoscyamine-6S-dioxygenase-involved in the tropane alkaloid biosynthesis. Our analyses revealed that the genomes of D. stramonium show signatures of expansion, physicochemical divergence and/or positive selection on proteins related to the production of tropane alkaloids, terpenoids, and glycoalkaloids as well as on R defensive genes and other important proteins related with biotic and abiotic pressures such as defense against natural enemies and drought.">

        <span class="abst" title="Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is famous for its unique fragrance derived from the essential oil of heartwood, whose major components are santalols. To understand the mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of santalols, in this study, we cloned two related genes involved in the mevalonate pathway in S. album coding for acetyl-CoA C-acetyl transferase (AACT) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutary-CoA synthase (HMGS). These genes were characterized and functionally analyzed, and their expression profiles were also assessed. An AACT gene designated as SaAACT (GenBank accession No. MH018694) and a HMGS gene designated as SaHMGS (GenBank accession No. MH018695) were successfully cloned from S. album. The deduced SaAACT and SaHMGS proteins contain 415 and 470 amino acids, and the corresponding size of their open-reading frames is 1538Â bp and 1807Â bp, respectively. Phylogenetic trees showed that the SaAACT protein had the closest relationship with AACT from Hevea brasiliensis and the SaHMGS proteins had the highest homology with HMGS from Siraitia grosvenorii. Functional complementation of SaAACT and SaHMGS in a mutant yeast strain deficient in these proteins confirmed that SaAACT and SaHMGS cDNA encodes functional SaAACT and SaHMGS that mediate mevalonate biosynthesis in yeast. Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed that both genes were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues (roots, sapwood, heartwood, young leaves, mature leaves and shoots) of S. album, both genes showing highest expression in roots. After S. album seedlings were treated with 100Â Î¼M methyl jasmonate, the expression levels of SaAACT and SaHMGS genes increased, suggesting that these genes were responsive to this elicitor. These studies provide insight that would allow further analysis of the role of genes related to the sandalwood mevalonate pathway in the regulation of biosynthesis of sandalwood terpenoids and a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of santalol biosynthesis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoids are a wide class of organic compounds with industrial relevance. The natural ability of cyanobacteria to produce terpenoids via the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway makes these organisms appealing candidates for the generation of light-driven cell factories for green chemistry. Here we address the improvement of the production of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Î±-bisabolene, a valuable biofuel feedstock, in &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC 6803 via sequential heterologous expression of bottleneck enzymes of the native pathway. Expression of the bisabolene synthase is sufficient to complete the biosynthetic pathway of bisabolene. Expression of a farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; did not influence production of bisabolene, while enhancement of the MEP pathway via additional overexpression of 1-deoxy-&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and IPP/DMAPP isomerase (IDI) significantly increased production per cell. However, in the absence of a carbon sink, the overexpression of DXS and IDI leads to significant growth impairment. The final engineered strain reached a volumetric titre of 9Â â€‹mgÂ â€‹L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; culture of bisabolene after growing for 12 days. When the cultures were grown in a high cell density (HCD) system, we observed an increase in the volumetric titres by one order of magnitude for all producing-strains. The strain with improved MEP pathway presented an increase twice as much as the remaining engineered strains, yielding more than 180Â â€‹mgÂ â€‹L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; culture after 10 days of cultivation. Furthermore, the overexpression of these two MEP enzymes prevented the previously reported decrease in the bisabolene specific titres when grown in HCD conditions, where primary metabolism is usually favoured. We conclude that fine-tuning of the cyanobacterial terpenoid pathway is crucial for the generation of microbial platforms for terpenoid production on industrial-scale.">

In a systematic synthetic biology driven approach, we recombined genes from three TS biosynthetic gene clusters (pycnidione 1, xenovulene A 2 and eupenifeldin 3) in the fungal host Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1. Rational design of the reconstituted pathways granted control over the number of hDA reactions taking place, the chemical nature of the fused polyketide moiety (tropolono- vs. monobenzo-pyranyl) and the degree of hydroxylation.

While the biosynthesis of terpenes has been described in plants and microorganisms, few terpene synthases (TPSs) have been identified in insects. Here, we study the recent divergence of 2 species, H. melpomene and Heliconius cydno, which differ in the presence of (E)-Î²-ocimene; combining linkage mapping, gene expression, and functional analyses, we identify 2 novel TPSs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one, HmelOS, is able to synthesise (E)-Î²-ocimene in vitro. We find no evidence for TPS activity in HcydOS (HmelOS ortholog of H. cydno), suggesting that the loss of (E)-Î²-ocimene in this species is the result of coding, not regulatory, differences. The TPS enzymes we discovered are unrelated to previously described plant and insect TPSs, demonstrating that chemical convergence has independent evolutionary origins.">

While still under discussion, particularly whether the genus is polytypic or monotypic, this broad classification reflects putative geographical origins of each group and putative chemotype and pharmacologic effect.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Here we describe a thorough investigation of cannabis accessions using a set of 23 highly informative and polymorphic SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) markers associated with important traits such as cannabinoid and terpenoid expression as well as fibre and resin production. The assay offers insight into cannabis population structure, phylogenetic relationship, population genetics and correlation to secondary metabolite concentrations. We demonstrate the utility of the assay for rapid, repeatable and cost-efficient genotyping of commercial and industrial cannabis accessions for use in product traceability, breeding programs, regulatory compliance and consumer education.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We identified 5 clusters in the sample set, including industrial hemp (K5) and resin hemp, which likely underwent a bottleneck to stabilize cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) accumulation (K2, Type II &amp; III). Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) resin (Type I) makes up the other three clusters with terpinolene (K4 - colloquial &quot;sativa&quot; or &quot;Narrow Leaflet Drug&quot; (NLD), myrcene/pinene (K1) and myrcene/limonene/linalool (K3 - colloquial &quot;indica&quot;, &quot;Broad Leaflet Drug&quot; (BLD), which also putatively harbour an active version of the cannabichrometic acid Synthase gene (CBCAS).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The final chemical compositions of cannabis products have key traits related to their genetic identities. Our analyses in the context of the NCBI Cannabis sativa Annotation Release 100 allows for hypothesis testing with regards to secondary metabolite production. Genetic markers related to secondary metabolite production will be important in many sectors of the cannabis marketplace. For example, markers related to THC production will be important for adaptable and compliant large-scale seed production under the new US Domestic Hemp Production Program.">

        <span class="abst" title="Zucchini (&lt;i&gt;Cucurbita pepo&lt;/i&gt; L.) is widely cultivated in temperate regions. One of the major production challenges is the damage caused by &lt;i&gt;Aphis gossypii&lt;/i&gt; (Homoptera: Aphididae), a polyphagous aphid, which can negatively affect its host plant, both directly by feeding and indirectly by vectoring viruses. To gain insights into the transcriptome events that occur during the zucchini-aphid interaction and to understand the early-to-late defense response through gene expression profiles, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) on zucchini leaves challenged by &lt;i&gt;A. gossypii&lt;/i&gt; (24, 48, and 96 h post-infestation; hpi). Data analysis indicated a complex and dynamic pattern of gene expression and a transient transcriptional reconfiguration that involved more than 700 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including a large number of defense-related genes. The down-regulation of key genes of plant immunity, such as leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein kinases, transcription factors, and genes associated with direct (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, protease inhibitors, cysteine peptidases, etc.) and indirect (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, terpene synthase) defense responses, suggests the aphid ability to manipulate plant immune responses. We also investigated the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from infested plants and observed a reduced emission of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Î²-caryophyllene at 48 hpi, likely the result of aphid effectors, which reflects the down-regulation of two genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. We showed that (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Î²-caryophyllene emission was modified by the duration of plant infestation and by aphid density and that this molecule highly attracts &lt;i&gt;Aphidius colemani&lt;/i&gt;, a parasitic wasp of &lt;i&gt;A. gossypii&lt;/i&gt;. With our results we contributed to the identification of genes involved in cucurbit plant interactions with phloem feeders. Our findings may also help pave the way toward developing tolerant zucchini varieties and to identify molecules for sustainable management of harmful insect populations.">

However, whether and how light affects the host defense which further affects insect preference and performance, remains unclear, nor has been demonstrated how pathogens co-adapt light condition to facilitate vector transmission. We previously showed that begomoviral Î²C1 inhibits MYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling to establish plant-dependent mutualism with its insect vector. Here we show red-light as an environmental catalyzer to promote mutualism of whitefly-begomovirus by stabilizing Î²C1, which interacts with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) transcription factors. PIFs positively control plant defenses against whitefly by directly binding to the promoter of terpene synthase genes and promoting their transcription. Moreover, PIFs interact with MYC2 to integrate light and jasmonate signaling and regulate the transcription of terpene synthase genes. However, begomovirus encoded Î²C1 inhibits PIFs' and MYC2' transcriptional activity via disturbing their dimerization, thereby impairing plant defenses against whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses. Our results thus describe how a viral pathogen hijacks host external and internal signaling to enhance the mutualistic relationship with its insect vector.">

Herein, we explored the biosynthetic potential of &lt;i&gt;R. mucilaginosa&lt;/i&gt; 50-3-19/20B collected from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge using modern genomics and untargeted metabolomics tools. &lt;i&gt;R. mucilaginosa&lt;/i&gt; 50-3-19/20B exhibited anticancer activity when grown on PDA medium, while antimicrobial activity was observed when cultured on WSP-30 medium. Applying the bioactive molecular networking approach, the anticancer activity was linked to glycolipids, namely polyol esters of fatty acid (PEFA) derivatives. We purified four PEFAs (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and the known methyl-2-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-2-yl)propanoate (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). Their structures were deduced from NMR and HR-MS/MS spectra, but &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; showed no anticancer activity in their pure form. Illumina-based genome sequencing, &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; assembly and standard biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) analyses were used to illustrate key components of the PEFA biosynthetic pathway. The fatty acid producing BGC3 was identified to be capable of producing precursors of PEFAs. Some &lt;i&gt;Rhodotorula&lt;/i&gt; strains are able to convert inulin into high-yielding PEFA and cell lipid using a native exo-inulinase enzyme. The genomic locus for an exo-inulinase enzyme (g1629.t1), which plays an instrumental role in the PEFA production via the mannitol biosynthesis pathway was identified. This is the first untargeted metabolomics study on &lt;i&gt;R. mucilaginosa&lt;/i&gt; providing new genomic insights into PEFA biosynthesis.">

The goal of this study was to investigate the biochemical functions of SmMTPSLs. Here, eight full-length &lt;i&gt;SmMTPSL&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;SmMTPSL5, -15, -19, -23, -33, -37, -46,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;-47)&lt;/i&gt; were functionally characterized from &lt;i&gt;S. moellendorffii&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli-&lt;/i&gt;expressed recombinant SmMTPSLs were tested for monoterpenes synthase and sesquiterpenes synthase activities. These enzymatic products were typical monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that have been previous shown to be generated by typical plant TPSs when provided with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates. Meanwhile, &lt;i&gt;SmMTPSL23&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;-33&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;-37&lt;/i&gt; were up-regulated when induced by alamethicin (ALA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting a role for these genes in plants response to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study pointed out that the terpenoids products of SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 have an antibacterial effect on &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;tomato&lt;/i&gt; DC3000 and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

However, some salt-tolerant strains of &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Penicillium&lt;/i&gt; produce ochratoxin A (OTA) on these products and thus threaten food safety. In our study, proteomic analysis was performed to reveal the mechanism of adaptability to high-salt environment by &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus ochraceus&lt;/i&gt;. Twenty g/L and 70 g/L NaCl substrates were used to provide medium- and high-NaCl content environments, respectively. The NaCl addition could induce fungal growth, but only 20 g/L NaCl addition could induce spore production while 70 g/L repressed it. Proteomics analysis identified 2646 proteins in &lt;i&gt;A. ochraceus&lt;/i&gt; fc-1, of which 237 and 251 were differentially expressed with 20 g/L and 70 g/L NaCl addition, respectively. Potential factors affecting fungal growth and development were identified by GO and KEGG analyses of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function terms. The results revealed that ergosterol synthesis pathway was significantly upregulated with 20 g/L and 70 g/L NaCl addition. However, fungal growth and development including OTA production were complex processes associated with many factors including nutrient uptake, cell membrane integrity, cell cycle, energy metabolism, intracellular redox homeostasis, protein synthesis and processing, autophagy, and secondary metabolism. Reactive oxygen species may be an important window to understand the mechanism that medium-salt content was conducive to intracellular signal transduction while high-salt content caused oxidative stress. The findings would help to improve the processes and storage conditions of dry-cured meat products.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoids constitute one of the largest and most diverse groups within the class of secondary metabolites, comprising over 80,000 compounds. They not only exhibit important functions in plant physiology but also have commercial potential in the biotechnological, pharmaceutical, and agricultural sectors due to their promising properties, including various bioactivities against pathogens, inflammations, and cancer. In this work, we therefore aimed to implement the plant sesquiterpenoid pathway leading to Î²-caryophyllene in the heterologous host &lt;i&gt;Rhodobacter capsulatus&lt;/i&gt; and achieved a maximum production of 139 Â± 31 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; culture. As this sesquiterpene offers various beneficial anti-phytopathogenic activities, we evaluated the bioactivity of Î²-caryophyllene and its oxygenated derivative Î²-caryophyllene oxide against different phytopathogenic fungi. Here, both compounds significantly inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;Sclerotinia sclerotiorum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; by up to 40%, while growth of &lt;i&gt;Alternaria brassicicola&lt;/i&gt; was only slightly affected, and &lt;i&gt;Phoma lingam&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rhizoctonia solani&lt;/i&gt; were unaffected. At the same time, the compounds showed a promising low inhibitory profile for a variety of plant growth-promoting bacteria at suitable compound concentrations. Our observations thus give a first indication that Î²-caryophyllene and Î²-caryophyllene oxide are promising natural agents, which might be applicable for the management of certain plant pathogenic fungi in agricultural crop production.">

        <span class="abst" title="Diabetes mellitus is a life-threatening multifactorial metabolic disorder characterized by high level of glucose in the blood. Diabetes and its chronic complications have a significant impact on human life, health systems, and countries' economies. Currently, there are many commercial hypoglycemic drugs that are effective in controlling hyperglycemia but with several serious side-effects and without a sufficient capacity to significantly alter the course of diabetic complications. Over many centuries mushrooms and their bioactive compounds have been used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially polysaccharides and terpenoids derived from various mushroom species. This review summarizes the effects of these main mushroom secondary metabolites on diabetes and underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for lowering blood glucose. In vivo and in vitro data revealed that treatment with mushroom polysaccharides displayed an anti-hyperglycemic effect by inhibiting glucose absorption efficacy, enhancing pancreatic &lt;i&gt;Î²&lt;/i&gt;-cell mass, and increasing insulin-signaling pathways. Mushroom terpenoids act as inhibitors of Î±-glucosidase and as insulin sensitizers through activation of PPAR&lt;i&gt;Î³&lt;/i&gt; in order to reduce hyperglycemia in animal models of diabetes. In conclusion, mushroom polysaccharides and terpenoids can effectively ameliorate hyperglycemia by various mechanisms and can be used as supportive candidates for prevention and control of diabetes in the future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Gibberella stalk rot (GSR) by &lt;i&gt;Fusarium graminearum&lt;/i&gt; causes significant losses of maize production worldwide. Jasmonates (JAs) have been broadly known in regulating defense against pathogens through the homeostasis of active JAs and COI-JAZ-MYC function module. However, the functions of different molecular species of JAs and COI-JAZ-MYC module in maize interactions with &lt;i&gt;Fusarium graminearum&lt;/i&gt; and regulation of diverse metabolites remain unknown. In this study, we found that exogenous application of MeJA strongly enhanced resistance to GSR. RNA-seq analysis showed that MeJA activated multiple genes in JA pathways, which prompted us to perform a genome-wide screening of key JA signaling components in maize. Yeast Two-Hybrid, Split-Luciferase, and Pull-down assays revealed that the JA functional and structural mimic coronatine (COR) functions as an essential ligand to trigger the interaction between ZmCOIa and ZmJAZ15. By deploying CRISPR-cas9 knockout and &lt;i&gt;Mutator&lt;/i&gt; insertional mutants, we demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;coi1a&lt;/i&gt; mutant is more resistant, whereas &lt;i&gt;jaz15&lt;/i&gt; mutant is more susceptible to GSR. Moreover, JA-deficient &lt;i&gt;opr7-5opr8-2&lt;/i&gt; mutant displayed enhanced resistance to GSR compared to wild type. Together, these results provide strong evidence that &lt;i&gt;ZmJAZ15&lt;/i&gt; plays a pivotal role, whereas &lt;i&gt;ZmCOIa&lt;/i&gt; and endogenous JA itself might function as susceptibility factors, in maize immunity to GSR.">

Two previously characterized subgroup-IVa bHLH TFs, BIS1 (bHLH Iridoid Synthesis 1) and BIS2 regulate iridoid biosynthesis in the TIA pathway. We reanalyzed the recently updated &lt;i&gt;C. roseus&lt;/i&gt; genome sequence and discovered that &lt;i&gt;BIS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BIS2&lt;/i&gt; are clustered on the same genomic scaffold with a previously uncharacterized bHLH gene, designated as &lt;i&gt;BIS3&lt;/i&gt;. Only a few bHLH gene clusters have been studied to date. Comparative analysis of 49 genome sequences from different plant lineages revealed the presence of analogous bHLH clusters in core angiosperms, including the medicinal plants &lt;i&gt;Calotropis gigantea&lt;/i&gt; (giant milkweed) and &lt;i&gt;Gelsemium sempervirens&lt;/i&gt; (yellow jessamine), but not in the analyzed basal angiosperm and lower plants. Similar to the iridoid pathway genes, &lt;i&gt;BIS3&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in roots and induced by methyl jasmonate. BIS3 activates the promoters of iridoid branch genes, &lt;i&gt;geraniol synthase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;GES&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;geraniol 10-hydroxylase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;G10H&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;8-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;8HGO&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;iridoid synthase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IS&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;7-deoxyloganetic acid glucosyl transferase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;7-DLGT&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;7-deoxyloganic acid hydroxylase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;7DLH&lt;/i&gt;), but not &lt;i&gt;iridoid oxidase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IO&lt;/i&gt;). Transactivation of the promoters was abolished when BIS3 is converted to a dominant repressor by fusing with the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) sequence. In addition, BIS3 acts synergistically with BIS1 and BIS2 to activate the &lt;i&gt;G10H&lt;/i&gt; promoter in tobacco cells. Mutation of the known bHLH TF binding motif, G-box (CACGTG) in the &lt;i&gt;G10H&lt;/i&gt; promoter significantly reduced but did not abolish the transactivation by BIS3. Promoter deletion analysis of &lt;i&gt;G10H&lt;/i&gt; suggests that the sequences adjacent to the G-box are also involved in the regulation by BIS3. Overexpression of &lt;i&gt;BIS3&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;C. roseus&lt;/i&gt; flower petals significantly upregulated the expression of iridoid biosynthetic genes and increased loganic acid accumulation. &lt;i&gt;BIS2&lt;/i&gt; expression was significantly induced by BIS3 although BIS3 did not directly activate the &lt;i&gt;BIS2&lt;/i&gt; promoter. Our results advance our understanding of the regulation of plant specialized metabolites by bHLH TF clusters.">

        <span class="abst" title="Isoprenoids, also known as terpenes or terpenoids, represent a large family of natural products composed of five-carbon isopentenyl diphosphate or its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate as the building blocks. Isoprenoids are structurally and functionally diverse and include dolichols, steroid hormones, carotenoids, retinoids, aromatic metabolites, the isoprenoid side-chain of ubiquinone, and isoprenoid attached signaling proteins. Productions of isoprenoids are catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as prenyltransferases, such as farnesyltransferases, geranylgeranyltransferases, terpenoid cyclase, squalene synthase, aromatic prenyltransferase, and cis- and trans-prenyltransferases. Because these enzymes are key in cellular processes and metabolic pathways, they are expected to be potential targets in new drug discovery. In this review, six distinct subsets of characterized prenyltransferases are structurally and mechanistically classified, including (1) head-to-tail prenyl synthase, (2) head-to-head prenyl synthase, (3) head-to-middle prenyl synthase, (4) terpenoid cyclase, (5) aromatic prenyltransferase, and (6) protein prenylation. Inhibitors of those enzymes for potential therapies against several diseases are discussed. Lastly, recent results on the structures of integral membrane enzyme, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase, are also discussed.">

The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic structure of 509 wheat accessions representing registered varieties and advanced breeding lines via the high-density genotyping-by-sequencing approach.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;More than 30% of 13,499 SNP markers representing 2162 clusters were mapped to genes, whereas 22.50% of 26,369 silicoDArT markers overlapped with coding sequences and were linked in 3527 blocks. Regarding hexaploidy, perfect sequence matches following BLAST searches were not sufficient for the unequivocal mapping to unique loci. Moreover, allelic variations in homeologous loci interfered with heterozygosity calculations for some markers. Analyses of the major genetic changes over the last 27â€‰years revealed the selection pressure on orthologs of the gibberellin biosynthesis-related GA2 gene and the senescence-associated SAG12 gene. A core collection representing the wheat population was generated for preserving germplasm and optimizing breeding programs.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our results confirmed considerable differences among wheat subgenomes A, B and D, with D characterized by the lowest diversity but the highest LD.

        <span class="abst" title="Akebia trifoliata subsp. australis is a well-known medicinal and potential woody oil plant in China. The limited genetic information available for A. trifoliata subsp. australis has hindered its exploitation. Here, a high-quality chromosome-level genome sequence of A. trifoliata subsp. australis is reported. The de novo genome assembly of 682.14â€‰Mb was generated with a scaffold N50 of 43.11â€‰Mb. The genome includes 25,598 protein-coding genes, and 71.18% (485.55â€‰Mb) of the assembled sequences were identified as repetitive sequences. An ongoing massive burst of long terminal repeat (LTR) insertions, which occurred ~1.0 million years ago, has contributed a large proportion of LTRs in the genome of A. trifoliata subsp. australis. Phylogenetic analysis shows that A. trifoliata subsp. australis is closely related to Aquilegia coerulea and forms a clade with Papaver somniferum and Nelumbo nucifera, which supports the well-established hypothesis of a close relationship between basal eudicot species. The expansion of UDP-glucoronosyl and UDP-glucosyl transferase gene families and Î²-amyrin synthase-like genes and the exclusive contraction of terpene synthase gene families may be responsible for the abundant oleanane-type triterpenoids in A. trifoliata subsp. australis. Furthermore, the acyl-ACP desaturase gene family, including 12 stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase (SAD) genes, has expanded exclusively. A combined transcriptome and fatty-acid analysis of seeds at five developmental stages revealed that homologs of SADs, acyl-lipid desaturase omega fatty acid desaturases (FADs), and oleosins were highly expressed, consistent with the rapid increase in the content of fatty acids, especially unsaturated fatty acids. The genomic sequences of A. trifoliata subsp. australis will be a valuable resource for comparative genomic analyses and molecular breeding.">

Recently, it was shown for the first time that the biosynthesis of the unique homo-sesquiterpene sodorifen by Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 involves a methylated and cyclized intermediate as the substrate of the sodorifen synthase. To further support the proposed biosynthetic pathway, we now identified the cyclic prenyl pyrophosphate intermediate pre-sodorifen pyrophosphate (PSPP). Its absolute configuration (6R,7S,9S) was determined by comparison of calculated and experimental CD-spectra of its hydrolysis product and matches with those predicted by semi-empirical quantum calculations of the reaction mechanism. In silico modeling of the reaction mechanism of the FPP C-methyltransferase (FPPMT) revealed a S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 mechanism for the methyl transfer followed by a cyclization cascade. The cyclization of FPP to PSPP is guided by a catalytic dyad of H191 and Y39 and involves an unprecedented cyclopropyl intermediate. W46, W306, F56, and L239 form the hydrophobic binding pocket and E42 and H45 complex a magnesium cation that interacts with the diphosphate moiety of FPP. Six additional amino acids turned out to be essential for product formation and the importance of these amino acids was subsequently confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results reveal the reaction mechanism involved in methyltransferase-catalyzed cyclization and demonstrate that this coupling of C-methylation and cyclization of FPP by the FPPMT represents an alternative route of terpene biosynthesis that could increase the terpenoid diversity and structural space.">

In the last two decades, the interest in biocatalytic transformations has increased due to an urgent need for more sustainable industrial processes that comply with the principles of green chemistry. Thanks to the recent advances in biotechnologies, protein engineering and the Nobel prize awarded concept of direct enzymatic evolution, the synthetic enzymatic toolbox has expanded significantly. In particular, the implementation of biocatalysts in continuous flow systems has attracted much attention, especially from industry. The advantages of flow chemistry enable biosynthesis to overcome well-known limitations of &quot;classic&quot; enzymatic catalysis, such as time-consuming work-ups and enzyme inhibition, as well as difficult scale-up and process intensifications. Moreover, continuous flow biocatalysis provides access to practical, economical and more sustainable synthetic pathways, an important aspect for the future of pharmaceutical companies if they want to compete in the market while complying with European Medicines Agency (EMA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and green chemistry requirements. This review focuses on the most recent advances in the use of flow biocatalysis for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), pharmaceuticals and natural products, and the advantages and limitations are discussed.">

Combined genomic tools and metabolomic screening of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; spp. native to extreme environments could be a promising strategy to discover novel compounds. While &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; of desertic origin have been proposed as a source of new metabolites, their genome mining, phylogenetic analysis, and metabolite profiles to date are scarcely documented. Here, we hypothesized that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; species of desert environments have evolved with unique biosynthetic potential. To test this, along with an extensive characterization of biosynthetic potential of a desert isolate &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. SAJ15, we profiled phylogenetic relationships among the closest and previously reported &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; of desert origin. Results revealed that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; strains of desert origin are closer to each other and relatively distinct from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; of other environments. The draft genome of strain SAJ15 was 8.2 Mb in size, which had 6972 predicted genes including 3097 genes encoding hypothetical proteins. Successive genome mining and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of putative novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with low incidence in another &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, high-resolution metabolite profiling indicated the production of arylpolyene, terpenoid, and macrolide compounds in an optimized medium by strain SAJ15. The relative abundance of different BGCs in arid &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; differed from the non-arid counterparts. Collectively, the results suggested a distinct evolution of desert &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; with a unique biosynthetic potential.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pathogen infection often leads to the enhanced formation of specialized plant metabolites that act as defensive barriers against microbial attackers. In this study, we investigated the formation of potential defense compounds in roots of the Western balsam poplar (&lt;i&gt;Populus trichocarpa&lt;/i&gt;) upon infection with the generalist root pathogen &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cactorum&lt;/i&gt; (Oomycetes). &lt;i&gt;P. cactorum&lt;/i&gt; infection led to an induced accumulation of terpenes, aromatic compounds, and fatty acids in poplar roots. Transcriptome analysis of uninfected and &lt;i&gt;P. cactorum&lt;/i&gt;-infected roots revealed a terpene synthase gene &lt;i&gt;PtTPS5&lt;/i&gt; that was significantly induced upon pathogen infection. PtTPS5 had been previously reported as a sesquiterpene synthase producing two unidentified sesquiterpene alcohols as major products and hedycaryol as a minor product. Using heterologous expression in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, enzyme assays with deuterium-labeled substrates, and NMR analysis of reaction products, we could identify the major PtTPS5 products as (1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,7&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,10&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-guaia-4(15)-en-11-ol and (1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,7&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,10&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-guaia-4-en-11-ol, with the former being a novel compound. The transcript accumulation of &lt;i&gt;PtTPS5&lt;/i&gt; in uninfected and &lt;i&gt;P. cactorum&lt;/i&gt;-infected poplar roots matched the accumulation of (1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,7&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,10&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-guaia-4(15)-en-11-ol, (1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,7&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,10&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-guaia-4-en-11-ol, and hedycaryol in this tissue, suggesting that PtTPS5 likely contributes to the pathogen-induced formation of these compounds in planta.">

PE are abundant in the seeds of the biofuel crop Jatropha curcas and its toxicity precludes the use of the protein-rich cake obtained after oil extraction as an animal feed and the toxicity of the fumes derived from burning PE containing biofuel is also a matter of concern. This toxicity is a major hindrance to exploit the potential of this crop as a source of raw material to produce biodiesel. For this reason, the current research on J. curcas is mainly focused on the understanding of the biosynthesis and site of synthesis of PE, as an avenue for the development of genotypes unable to synthesize PE in its seeds.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Here, we present targeted proteomics assays (SRM and PRM) to detect and quantify CS in leaves, endosperm, and roots of two J. curcas genotypes with contrasting levels of PE. These assays were based on the use of reference isotopic labeled synthetic peptides (ILSP) predicted from 12 gene models of CS from the J. curcas genome.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our targeted proteomics methods were able to detect and quantify, for the first time, CS gene products and demonstrate the distribution of CS isoforms only in roots from J. curcas genotypes with a high and low concentration of PE. These methods can be expanded to monitor CS, at the protein level, in different tissues and genotypes of J. curcas.">

        <span class="abst" title="Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plants, but crop plants are inefficient in the acquisition and utilization of applied nitrogen. This often results in producers over applying nitrogen fertilizers, which can negatively impact the environment. The development of crop plants with more efficient nitrogen usage is, therefore, an important research goal in achieving greater agricultural sustainability. We utilized genetically modified rice lines over-expressing a barley alanine aminotransferase (&lt;i&gt;HvAlaAT&lt;/i&gt;) to help characterize pathways which lead to more efficient use of nitrogen. Under the control of a stress-inducible promoter &lt;i&gt;OsAnt1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;OsAnt1:HvAlaAT&lt;/i&gt; lines have increased above-ground biomass with little change to both nitrate and ammonium uptake rates. Based on metabolic profiles, carbon metabolites, particularly those involved in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, were significantly altered in roots of &lt;i&gt;OsAnt1:HvAlaAT&lt;/i&gt; lines, suggesting higher metabolic turnover. Moreover, transcriptomic data revealed that genes involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle were upregulated. These observations suggest that higher activity of these two processes could result in higher energy production, driving higher nitrogen assimilation, consequently increasing biomass production. Other potential mechanisms contributing to a nitrogen-use efficient phenotype include involvements of phytohormonal responses and an alteration in secondary metabolism. We also conducted basic growth studies to evaluate the effect of the &lt;i&gt;OsAnt1:HvAlaAT&lt;/i&gt; transgene in barley and wheat, which the transgenic crop plants increased seed production under controlled environmental conditions. This study provides comprehensive profiling of genetic and metabolic responses to the over-expression of &lt;i&gt;AlaAT&lt;/i&gt; and unravels several components and pathways which contribute to its nitrogen-use efficient phenotype.">

This strain is mainly recognized for being a model wild-type lovastatin producer and a parental strain of high-yielding industrial mutants. It is also a microorganism with a rich repertoire of secondary metabolites that has been a subject of numerous bioprocess-related studies. In terms of continuity, the genomic sequence provided in this work is of the highest quality among all the publicly available genomes of A. terreus strains. The comparative analysis revealed considerable diversity with regard to the catalog of biosynthetic gene clusters found in A. terreus. Even though the cluster of lovastatin biosynthesis was found to be well-conserved at the species level, several unique genes putatively associated with metabolic functions were detected in A. terreus ATCC 20542 that were not detected in other investigated genomes. The analysis was conducted also in the context of the primary metabolic pathways (sugar catabolism, biomass degradation potential, organic acid production), where the visible differences in gene copy numbers were detected. However, the species-level genomic diversity of A. terreus was more evident for secondary metabolism than for the well-conserved primary metabolic pathways. The newly sequenced genome of A. terreus ATCC 20542 was found to harbor several unique sequences, which can be regarded as interesting subjects for future experimental efforts on A. terreus metabolism and fungal biosynthetic capabilities. KEY POINTS: â€¢ The high-quality genome of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 has been assembled and annotated. â€¢ Comparative analysis with other sequenced Aspergillus terreus strains has revealed considerable diversity in biosynthetic gene repertoire, especially related to secondary metabolism. â€¢ The unique genomic features of A. terreus ATCC 20542 are discussed.">

Here, we combine experiment and simulation to guide the redesign of its active site pocket to avoid hydroxylation of the product. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate two regions between which water molecules can flow that are responsible for hydroxylation. Point mutations of selected residues result in variants that predominantly form a complex nonhydroxylated product, which we identify as isolepidozene. Our results indicate how these mutations subtly change the molecular choreography in the Gd11olS active site and thereby pave the way for the engineering of terpene synthases to make complex terpenoid products.">

A conditional gene inactivation tool is required when gene deletion is lethal or detrimental to growth. Here, we exploit auxin-inducible protein degradation as a metabolic engineering approach in yeast. We demonstrate its effectiveness using terpenoid production. First, we target an essential prenyl-pyrophosphate metabolism protein, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (Erg20p). Degradation successfully redirects metabolic flux toward monoterpene (C10) production. Second, depleting hexokinase-2, a key protein in glucose signalling transduction, lifts glucose repression and boosts production of sesquiterpene (C15) nerolidol to 3.5â€‰gâ€‰L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in flask cultivation. Third, depleting acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p), another essential protein, delivers growth arrest without diminishing production capacity in nerolidol-producing yeast, providing a strategy to decouple growth and production. These studies demonstrate auxin-mediated protein degradation as an advanced tool for metabolic engineering. It also has potential for broader metabolic perturbation studies to better understand metabolism.">

For example, linalool synthases are indispensable for the biosynthesis of linalool, an important fragrance used in 60-80% cosmetic and personal care products. However, plant linalool synthases have low activities while expressed in microbes. Aided by bioinformatics analysis, four linalool/nerolidol synthases (LNSs) from various Agaricomycetes were accurately predicted and validated experimentally. Furthermore, we discovered a linalool synthase (Ap.LS) with exceptionally high levels of selectivity and activity from Agrocybe pediades, ideal for linalool bioproduction. It effectively converted glucose into enantiopure (R)-linalool in Escherichia coli, 44-fold and 287-fold more efficient than its bacterial and plant counterparts, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the divergent evolution paths for plant, bacterial and fungal linalool synthases. More critically, structural comparison provided catalytic insights into Ap.LS superior specificity and activity, and mutational experiments validated the key residues responsible for the specificity.">

Some terpenes are essential for plant growth and development, membrane components, and photosynthesis. Terpenes are also economically useful for industry, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals. However, there is very low content of most terpenes in microbes and plants. Chemical or microbial synthesis of terpenes are often costly. Plants have the elaborate and economic biosynthetic way of producing high-value terpenes through photosynthesis. Here we engineered the heterogenous sesquiterpenoid patchoulol production in &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt;. When using a strong promoter such as 35S to over express the avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene and patchoulol synthase gene, the highest content of patchoulol was 52.58 Î¼g/g DW in transgenic plants. When altering the subcellular location of the introduced sesquiterpene synthetase via a signal peptide, the accumulation of patchoulol was observably increased to 273 Î¼g/g DW.

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoids are a large and diverse group of natural products with commercial applications. Microbial production of terpenes is considered as a feasible approach for the stable supply of these complex hydrocarbons. Cyanobacteria, photosynthetic prokaryotes, are attractive hosts for sustainable bioproduction, because these autotrophs require only light and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for growth. Despite cyanobacteria having been engineered to produce a variety of compounds, their productivities of terpenes are generally low. Further research is needed to determine the bottleneck reactions for enhancing terpene production in cyanobacteria. In this study, we engineered the fast-growing cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus elongatus&lt;/i&gt; UTEX 2973 to produce a commercially-used terpenoid, limonene. We identified a beneficial mutation in the gene encoding geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase &lt;i&gt;crtE&lt;/i&gt;, leading to a 2.5-fold increase in limonene production. The engineered strain produced 16.4Â â€‹mgÂ â€‹L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of limonene at a rate of 8.2Â â€‹mgÂ â€‹L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 8-fold higher than limonene productivities previously reported in other cyanobacterial species. Furthermore, we employed a combinatorial metabolic engineering approach to optimize genes involved in the upstream pathway of limonene biosynthesis. By modulating the expression of genes encoding the enzymes in the MEP pathway and the geranyl pyrophosphate synthase, we showed that optimization of the expression level is critical to enhance limonene production in cyanobacteria.">

Despite the wealth of information gained over the years on Taxol research, there still remains supply issues to meet increasing clinical demand. Although alternative Taxol production methods have been developed, they still face several drawbacks that cause supply shortages and high production costs. It is highly desired to develop biotechnological production platforms for Taxol, however, there are still gaps in our understanding of the biosynthetic pathway, catalytic enzymes, regulatory and control mechanisms that hamper production of this critical drug by synthetic biology approaches. Over the past 5 years, significant advances were made in metabolic engineering and optimization of the Taxol pathway in different hosts, leading to accumulation of taxane intermediates. Computational and experimental approaches were leveraged to gain mechanistic insights into the catalytic cycle of pathway enzymes and guide rational protein engineering efforts to improve catalytic fitness and substrate/product specificity, especially of the cytochrome P450s (CYP450s). Notable breakthroughs were also realized in engineering the pathway in plant hosts that are more promising in addressing the challenging CYP450 chemistry. Here, we review these recent advances and in addition, we summarize recent transcriptomic data sets of &lt;i&gt;Taxus&lt;/i&gt; species and elicited culture cells, and give a bird's-eye view of the information that can be gleaned from these publicly available resources. Recent mining of transcriptome data sets led to discovery of two putative pathway enzymes, provided many lead candidates for the missing steps and provided new insights on the regulatory mechanisms governing Taxol biosynthesis. All these inferences are relevant to future biotechnological production of Taxol.">

Among described molecular and metabolic adaptations to enable functioning in the cold, there is the synthesis of cold-active proteins/enzymes. In bacterial cold-active proteins, reduced proline content and highly flexible and larger catalytic active sites than mesophylls counterparts have been described. However, beyond the low temperature, microorganisms' physiological requirements may differ according to their growth velocities, influencing their global protein compositions. This hypothesis was tested in this work using eight cold-adapted yeasts isolated from Antarctica, for which their growth parameters were measured and their draft genomes determined and bioinformatically analyzed. The optimal temperature for yeasts' growth ranged from 10 to 22Â°C, and yeasts having similar or same optimal temperature for growth displayed significative different growth rates. The sizes of the draft genomes ranged from 10.7 (&lt;i&gt;Tetracladium&lt;/i&gt; sp.) to 30.7 Mb (&lt;i&gt;Leucosporidium creatinivorum&lt;/i&gt;), and the GC contents from 37 (&lt;i&gt;Candida sake&lt;/i&gt;) to 60% (&lt;i&gt;L. creatinivorum&lt;/i&gt;). Putative genes related to various kinds of stress were identified and were especially numerous for oxidative and cold stress responses. The putative proteins were classified according to predicted cellular function and subcellular localization. The amino acid composition was compared among yeasts considering their optimal temperature for growth and growth rates. In several groups of predicted proteins, correlations were observed between their contents of flexible amino acids and both the yeasts' optimal temperatures for growth and their growth rates. In general, the contents of flexible amino acids were higher in yeasts growing more rapidly as their optimal temperature for growth was lower. The contents of flexible amino acids became lower among yeasts with higher optimal temperatures for growth as their growth rates increased.">

        <span class="abst" title="Excessive lung inflammation caused by endotoxins, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mediates the detrimental effects of acute lung injury (ALI), as evidenced by severe alveolar epithelial cell injury. CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, serves as a central activator in triggering and transducing a series of severe inflammatory events during the pathological processes of ALI. GinkgolideÂ CÂ (GC) is an efficient and specific inhibitor of CD40. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether GC alleviated LPSâ€‘induced ALI, as well as the potential underlying mechanisms. LPSâ€‘injured wildâ€‘type and CD40 gene conditional knockout mice, and primary cultured alveolar epithelial cells isolated from these mice served as &lt;i&gt;inÂ vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inÂ vitro&lt;/i&gt; ALI models, respectively. In the present study, histopathological assessment, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration, lung injury score, myeloperoxidase activity, wetâ€‘toâ€‘dry (W/D) weight ratio and hydroxyproline (Hyp) activity were assessed to evaluate lung injury. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate intracellular adhesion moleculeâ€‘1, vascular cell adhesion moleculeâ€‘1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression levels, and TNFâ€‘Î±, ILâ€‘1Î², ILâ€‘6 ELISAs and western blotting were conducted to elucidate the signaling pathway. The results demonstrated that GC alleviated LPSâ€‘induced lung injury, as evidenced by improvements in ultrastructural characteristics and histopathological alterations of lung tissue, inhibited PMN infiltration, as well as reduced lung injury score, W/D weight ratio and hydroxyproline content. In LPSâ€‘injured alveolar epithelial cells, GC significantly reduced IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation, IKKÎ² activity and NFâ€‘ÎºB p65 subunit translocation via downregulating CD40, leading to a significant decrease in downstream inflammatory cytokine levels and protein expression levels. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that GC displayed a protective effect against LPSâ€‘induced ALI via inhibition of the CD40/NFâ€‘ÎºB signaling pathway; therefore, the present study suggested that the CD40/NFâ€‘ÎºB signaling pathway might serve as a potential therapeutic target for ALI.">

Different signaling molecules may influence the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. Here, we investigated the potential of the basidiomycete Tricholoma vaccinum to produce communication molecules for the interaction with its coniferous host, Norway spruce (Picea abies). We focused on the production of volatile organic compounds and phytohormones in axenic T. vaccinum cultures, identified the potential biosynthesis genes, and investigated their expression by RNA-Seq analyses. T. vaccinum released volatiles not usually associated with fungi, like limonene and Î²-barbatene, and geosmin. Using stable isotope labeling, the biosynthesis of geosmin was elucidated. The geosmin biosynthesis gene ges1 of T. vaccinum was identified, and up-regulation was scored during mycorrhiza, while a different regulation was seen with mycorrhizosphere bacteria. The fungus also released the volatile phytohormone ethylene and excreted salicylic and abscisic acid as well as jasmonates into the medium. The tree excreted the auxin, indole-3-acetic acid, and its biosynthesis intermediate, indole-3-acetamide, as well as salicylic acid with its root exudates. These compounds could be shown for the first time in exudates as well as in soil of a natural ectomycorrhizospheric habitat. The effects of phytohormones present in the mycorrhizosphere on hyphal branching of T. vaccinum were assessed. Salicylic and abscisic acid changed hyphal branching in a concentration-dependent manner. Since extensive branching is important for mycorrhiza establishment, a well-balanced level of mycorrhizospheric phytohormones is necessary. The regulation thus can be expected to contribute to an interkingdom language.">

        <span class="abst" title="Basil (&lt;i&gt;Ocimum basilicum&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an essential ingredient of the Mediterranean cuisine due to its distinctive aroma. Genovese basil leaves are used to prepare &quot;pesto&quot;, a condiment that has always caught the interest of consumers and producers. Usually, basil for industrial processing is harvested more than once to extract a higher yield. However, successive cuts can affect quality traits that play a crucial role in defining the product's final sensory profile. This research was aimed to evaluate the impact of cut on the quantitative and qualitative properties of three Genovese basil cultivars (Aroma 2, Eleonora and Italiano Classico) grown in an open field. Nitrate content, phenolic acids and aromatic profile were determined by ion chromatography (IC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) analysis, respectively. The second harvest increased fresh biomass and total phenolic acids content by 172% and 413%, respectively, with Italiano Classico recording the highest values. The combination of second-cut Aroma 2 yielded the lowest nitrate (473.8 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of fresh weight) and Eugenol (2.4%) levels. In the second harvest, Eleonora showed an increase in eugenol and trans-Î±-bergamotene of 75.3% and 48.2%, respectively; whereas, eucalyptol and Î²-cis-ocimene decreased by 34.4% and 51.6%, respectively. Although successive harvests may increase basil yield and quality overall, the cultivar-dependent response to successive cuts needs to be accounted for in order to accomplish standardization of industrial &quot;pesto&quot; sauce.">

Here we present the results of comparative transcriptome analysis in genetically identical one-year-old Scots pine ramets after wounding and inoculation with &lt;i&gt;Heterobasidion annosum&lt;/i&gt;. We identified 230 genes that were more than 2-fold upregulated in inoculated samples (compared to controls) and 116 downregulated genes. Comparison of inoculated samp les with wounded samples identified 32 differentially expressed genes (30 were upregulated after inoculation). Several of the genes upregulated after inoculation are involved in protection from oxidative stress, while genes involved in photosynthesis, water transport and drought stress tolerance were downregulated. An NRT3 family protein was the most upregulated transcript in response to both inoculation and wounding, while a U-box domain-containing protein gene was the most upregulated gene comparing inoculation to wounding. The observed transcriptome dynamics suggest involvement of auxin, ethylene, jasmonate, gibberellin and reactive oxygen species pathways and cell wall modification regulation in response to &lt;i&gt;H. annosum&lt;/i&gt; infection. The results are compared to methyl jasmonate induced transcriptome dynamics.">

Applying MÎ²CD to cultures of &lt;i&gt;C. reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; lead to the sequestration of the two main sterols (ergosterol and 7-dehydroporiferasterol) into the growth medium and the intracellular accumulation of the intermediate cycloartenol, without compromising cell growth. When MÎ²CD was applied in combination with MeJA, it counteracted the negative effects of MeJA on cell growth and physiology, but no synergistic effect on triterpene yield was observed. Together, our findings provide strategies for the triterpene enrichment of microalgal biomass and medium.">

In this study, molecular networking of the 100 metabolite extracts derived from applying the OSMAC approach to 25 Polar bacterial strains, showed growth media specificity and potential chemical novelty was suggested. Moreover, the metabolite extracts were screened for antibacterial activity and promising selective bioactivity against drug-persistent pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; was observed. Genome sequencing data were combined with metabolomics experiments in the recently developed computational approach, NPLinker, which was used to link BGC and molecular features to prioritise strains for further investigation based on biosynthetic and chemical information. Herein, we putatively identified the known metabolites ectoine and chrloramphenicol which, through NPLinker, were linked to their associated BGCs. The metabologenomics approach followed in this study can potentially be applied to any large microbial datasets for accelerating the discovery of new (bioactive) specialised metabolites.">

However, differences in aroma components and relevant biosynthesis genes have not been systematically investigated in green and red prickly ash. Here, through the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially abundant metabolites, and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, we characterize the different aroma components of green and red prickly ash fruits and identify key genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify 41 terpenoids from green prickly ash and 61 terpenoids from red prickly ash. Piperitone was the most abundant terpenoid in green prickly ash fruit, whereas limonene was most abundant in red prickly ash. Intergroup correlation analysis and redundancy analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;HDS2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MVK2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;MVD&lt;/i&gt; are key genes for terpenoid synthesis in green prickly ash, whereas &lt;i&gt;FDPS2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FDPS3&lt;/i&gt; play an important role in the terpenoid synthesis of red prickly ash. In summary, differences in the composition and content of terpenoids are the main factors that cause differences in the aromas of green and red prickly ash, and these differences reflect contrasting expression patterns of terpenoid synthesis genes.">

To better understand the genetic basis of the terpenoid diversity in lavender, we present a high-quality reference genome for the Chinese lavender cultivar &quot;Jingxun 2&quot; using PacBio and Hi-C technologies to anchor the 894.50â€‰Mb genome assembly into 27 pseudochromosomes. In addition to the Î³ triplication event, lavender underwent two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) during the Eocene-Oligocene (29.6 MYA) and Miocene-Pliocene (6.9 MYA) transitions. As a result of tandem duplications and lineage-specific WGDs, gene families related to terpenoid biosynthesis in lavender are substantially expanded compared to those of five other species in Lamiaceae. Many terpenoid biosynthesis transcripts are abundant in glandular trichomes. We further integrated the contents of ecologically functional terpenoids and coexpressed terpenoid biosynthetic genes to construct terpenoid-gene networks. Typical gene clusters, including TPS-TPS, TPS-CYP450, and TPS-BAHD, linked with compounds that primarily function as attractants or repellents, were identified by their similar patterns of change during flower development or in response to methyl jasmonate. Comprehensive analysis of the genetic basis of the production of volatiles in lavender could serve as a foundation for future research into lavender evolution, phytochemistry, and ecology.">

        <span class="abst" title="The characteristic secondary metabolites in tea (theanine, caffeine, and catechins) are important factors contributing to unique tea flavors. However, there has been relatively little research on molecular markers related to these metabolites. Thus, we conducted a genome-wide association analysis of the levels of these tea flavor-related metabolites in three seasons. The theanine, caffeine, and catechin levels in Population 1 comprising 191 tea plant germplasms were examined, which revealed that their heritability exceeded 0.5 in the analyzed seasons, with the following rank order (highest to lowest heritabilities): (+)-catechinâ€‰&gt;â€‰(-)-gallocatechin gallateâ€‰&gt;â€‰caffeineâ€‰=â€‰(-)-epicatechinâ€‰&gt;â€‰(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallateâ€‰&gt;â€‰theanineâ€‰&gt;â€‰(-)-epigallocatechinâ€‰&gt;â€‰(-)-epicatechin-3-gallateâ€‰&gt;â€‰catechin gallateâ€‰&gt;â€‰(+)-gallocatechin. The SNPs detected by amplified-fragment SNP and methylation sequencing divided Population 1 into three groups and seven subgroups. An association analysis yielded 307 SNP markers related to theanine, caffeine, and catechins that were common to all three seasons. Some of the markers were pleiotropic. The functional annotation of 180 key genes at the SNP loci revealed that FLS, UGT, MYB, and WD40 domain-containing proteins, as well as ATP-binding cassette transporters, may be important for catechin synthesis. KEGG and GO analyses indicated that these genes are associated with metabolic pathways and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Moreover, in Population 2 (98 tea plant germplasm resources), 30 candidate SNPs were verified, including 17 SNPs that were significantly or extremely significantly associated with specific metabolite levels. These results will provide a foundation for future research on important flavor-related metabolites and may help accelerate the breeding of new tea varieties.">

The capability of the essential oil (EO) from inflorescences as antimicrobial agent has been reported. However, literature data are still lacking about the hemp EO antiprotozoal efficacy in vivo. The present study aims to unravel this concern through the evaluation of the efficacy of hemp EOs (2.5 mL/kg, intraperitoneally) of three different cultivars, namely &lt;i&gt;Futura 75&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carmagnola selezionata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eletta campana&lt;/i&gt;, in mice intraperitoneally infected with &lt;i&gt;Leishmania tropica&lt;/i&gt;. A detailed description of EO composition and targets-components analysis is reported. Myrcene, Î±-pinene and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene were the main components of the EOs, as indicated by the gas-chromatographic analysis. However, a prominent position in the scenario of the theoretical interactions underlying the bio-pharmacological activity was also occupied by selina-3,7(11)-diene, which displayed affinities in the micromolar range (5.4-28.9) towards proliferator-activated receptor Î±, cannabinoid CB2 receptor and acetylcholinesterase. The content of this compound was higher in &lt;i&gt;Futura 75&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eletta campana&lt;/i&gt;, in accordance with their higher scavenging/reducing properties and efficacy against the tissue wound, induced by &lt;i&gt;L. tropica&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, the present study recommends hemp female inflorescences, as sources of biomolecules with potential pharmacological applications, especially towards infective diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Linalool, an acyclic monoterpene alcohol, is extensively used in the flavor and fragrance industries and exists as two enantiomers, (S)- and (R)-linalool, which have different odors and biological properties. Linalool extraction from natural plant tissues suffers from low product yield. Although linalool can also be chemically synthesized, its enantioselective production is difficult. Microbial production of terpenes has recently emerged as a novel, environmental-friendly alternative. Stereoselective production can also be achieved using this approach via enzymatic reactions. We previously succeeded in producing enantiopure (S)-linalool using a metabolically engineered Pantoea ananatis, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria, via the heterologous mevalonate pathway with the highest linalool titer ever reported from engineered microbes.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Here, we genetically modified a previously developed P. ananatis strain expressing the (S)-linalool synthase (AaLINS) from Actinidia arguta to further improve (S)-linalool production. AaLINS was mostly expressed as an insoluble form in P. ananatis; its soluble expression level was increased by N-terminal fusion of a halophilic Î²-lactamase from Chromohalobacter sp. 560 with hexahistidine. Furthermore, in combination with elevation of the precursor supply via the mevalonate pathway, the (S)-linalool titer was increased approximately 1.4-fold (4.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.3Â g/L) in comparison with the original strain (3.4â€‰Â±â€‰0.2Â g/L) in test-tube cultivation with an aqueous-organic biphasic fermentation system using isopropyl myristate as the organic solvent for in situ extraction of cytotoxic and semi-volatile (S)-linalool. The most productive strain, IP04S/pBLAAaLINS-ispA*, produced 10.9Â g/L of (S)-linalool in &quot;dual-phase&quot; fed-batch fermentation, which was divided into a growth-phase and a subsequent production-phase. Thus far, this is the highest reported titer in the production of not only linalool but also all monoterpenes using microbes.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study demonstrates the potential of our metabolically engineered P. ananatis strain as a platform for economically feasible (S)-linalool production and provides insights into the stereoselective production of terpenes with high efficiency. This system is an environmentally friendly and economically valuable (S)-linalool production alternative. Mass production of enantiopure (S)-linalool can also lead to accurate assessment of its biological properties by providing an enantiopure substrate for study.">

However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of key genes &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27a/b&lt;/i&gt; in triptolide biosynthesis remains unclear. In this study, the promoters of &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27a&lt;/i&gt; (1496 bp) and &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27b&lt;/i&gt; (1862 bp) were isolated and analyzed. Some hormone-/stress-responsive elements and transcription factor (TF) binding sites were predicted in both promoters, which might be responsible for the regulation mechanism of &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27a/b&lt;/i&gt;. The Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) activity analysis in promoter deletion assays under normal and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) conditions showed that the sequence of -921 to -391 bp is the potential core region of the &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27b&lt;/i&gt; promoter. And the TGACG-motif, a MeJA-responsive element found in this core region, might be responsible for MeJA-mediated stress induction of GUS activity. Moreover, the TGACG-motif is also known as the TGA TF-binding site. Yeast one-hybrid and GUS transactivation assays confirmed the interaction between the &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27a/b&lt;/i&gt; promoters and the TwTGA1 TF (a MeJA-inducible TGA TF upregulating triptolide biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;T. wilfordii&lt;/i&gt;), indicating that &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27a/b&lt;/i&gt; are two target genes regulated by TwTGA1. In conclusion, our results provide important information for elucidating the regulatory mechanism of MS genes, &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TwTPS27b&lt;/i&gt;, as two target genes of TwTGA1, in jasmonic acid (JA)-inducible triptolide biosynthesis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Salt stress affects crop yield by limiting growth and delaying development. In this study, we constructed 16 transcriptome libraries from maize seedling roots using two maize lines, with contrasting salt tolerance, that were exposed to salt stress for 0, 6, 18 and 36 h. In total, 6,584 differential expression genes (DEGs; 3,669 upregulated, 2,915 downregulated) were induced in the salt-sensitive line and 6,419 DEGs (3,876 upregulated, 2,543 downregulated) were induced in the salt-tolerant line. Several DEGs common to both lines were enriched in the ABA signaling pathway, which was presumed to coordinate the process of maize salt response. A total of 459 DEGs were specifically induced in the salt-tolerant line and represented candidate genes responsible for high salt-tolerance. Expression pattern analysis for these DEGs indicated that the period between 0 and 6 h was a crucial period for the rapid response of the tolerant genes under salt stress. Among these DEGs, several genes, Aux/IAA, SAUR, and CBL-interacting kinase have been reported to regulate salt tolerance. In addition, the transcription factors WRKY, bZIP and MYB acted as regulators in the salt-responsive regulatory network of maize roots. Our findings will contribute to understanding of the mechanism on salt response and provide references for functional gene revelation in plants.">

In this article, we report a near-chromosome-level hybrid assembly of this fungus using a combination of short-read Illumina data to polish assemblies generated from long-read Nanopore data. The reference genome for L. rhizohalophila was assembled into 26 scaffolds with a total length of 64.0â€‰Mb and a N50 length of 3.15â€‰Mb. Of them, 17 scaffolds approached the length of intact chromosomes, and 5 had telomeres at one end only. A total of 10,891 gene models were predicted. Intriguingly, 27.5â€‰Mb of repeat sequences that accounted for 42.97% of the genome was identified, and long terminal repeat retrotransposons were the most frequent known transposable elements, indicating that transposable element proliferation contributes to its increased genome size. BUSCO analyses using the Fungi_odb10 data set showed that 95.0% of genes were complete. In addition, 292 carbohydrate active enzymes, 33 secondary metabolite clusters, and 84 putative effectors were identified in silico. The resulting high-quality assembly and genome features are not only an important resource for further research on understanding the mechanism of root-fungi symbiotic interactions but will also contribute to comparative analyses of genome biology and evolution within Pleosporalean species.">

Tomato plants have evolved broad defense mechanisms regulated by the expression of defense genes, phytohormones, and secondary metabolites present constitutively and/or induced upon infestation. Although tomato defense mechanisms have been studied for more than three decades, only a few studies have compared domesticated cultivars' natural mite resistance at the molecular level. The main goal of our research was to reveal the molecular differences between two tomato cultivars with similar physical (trichome morphology and density) and agronomic traits (fruit size, shape, color, cluster architecture), but with contrasting TSSM susceptibility. A net house experiment indicated a mite-resistance difference between the cultivars, and a climate-controlled performance and oviposition bioassay supported these findings. A transcriptome analysis of the two cultivars after 3 days of TSSM infestation, revealed changes in the genes associated with primary and secondary metabolism, including salicylic acid and volatile biosynthesis (volatile benzenoid ester and monoterpenes). The &lt;i&gt;Terpene synthase&lt;/i&gt; genes, &lt;i&gt;TPS5, TPS7&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;TPS19/20&lt;/i&gt;, encoding enzymes that synthesize the monoterpenes linalool, Î²-myrcene, limonene, and Î²-phellandrene were highly expressed in the resistant cultivar. The volatile profile of these cultivars upon mite infestation for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, revealed substantial differences in monoterpenoid and phenylpropanoid volatiles, results consistent with the transcriptomic data. Comparing the metabolic changes that occurred in each cultivar and upon mite-infestation indicated that monoterpenes are the main metabolites that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occurred upon TSSM attack. To test the effect of these volatile variations on mites, we subjected both the TSSM and its corresponding predator, &lt;i&gt;Phytoseiulus persimilis&lt;/i&gt;, to an olfactory choice bioassay. The predator mites were only significantly attracted to the TSSM pre-infested resistant cultivar and not to the susceptible cultivar, while the TSSM itself showed no preference. Overall, our findings revealed the contribution of constitutive and inducible levels of volatiles on mite performance. This study highlights monoterpenoids' function in plant resistance to pests and may inform the development of new resistant tomato cultivars.">

However, there is no information available on the role of the &lt;i&gt;SnRK&lt;/i&gt; gene family in &lt;i&gt;Hedychium coronarium&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;H. coronarium&lt;/i&gt; is an important crop widely cultivated as an ornamental plant, herb, spice, or condiment. In this study, 60 &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified from the &lt;i&gt;H. coronarium&lt;/i&gt; genomic and transcriptome data. Phylogenetic and gene structure analysis showed that the &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK&lt;/i&gt; genes were divided into three groups (&lt;i&gt;HcSnRK1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK3&lt;/i&gt;) and among them &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK3&lt;/i&gt; subfamily was further subdivided into two clades according to the number of introns. Chromosome localization analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly mapped onto all chromosomes, and the &lt;i&gt;Ka/Ks&lt;/i&gt; ratio of 24 paralogues includes four tandems and 20 segmental duplications indicated that the &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK&lt;/i&gt; gene family underwent a purifying selection. &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory elements analysis suggested that the &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK&lt;/i&gt; genes respond to multiple hormones and other stresses. The responsiveness of &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK&lt;/i&gt; genes to several hormones was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Based on the different transcriptome data, two candidates &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;HcSnRK2.2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK2.9&lt;/i&gt;) were screened out for further characterization . The subcellular localization experiment revealed that both genes were located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK2.2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK2.9&lt;/i&gt; significantly reduced the floral volatile contents by suppressing the expression of terpene synthase genes (&lt;i&gt;HcTPS1, HcTPS3,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcTPS5&lt;/i&gt;), indicating that &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK2.2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcSnRK2.9&lt;/i&gt; genes play an important role in the regulatory mechanism of floral aroma. These results will provide novel insights into the functional dissection of &lt;i&gt;H. coronarium SnRK&lt;/i&gt; gene family.">

The discovery of the biosynthesis of major phytocannabinoids has allowed the exploration of their heterologous production by synthetic biology, which may lead to the industrial production of rare phytocannabinoids or novel synthetic cannabinoid pharmaceuticals that are not easily offered by cannabis plants.

APES were loaded into carbopol gel (APEG) by dispersion method. Physico-chemical characterizations of the APES were done by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) etc. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; release, permeation, haemo-compatibility and anti-inflammatory studies were conducted. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; APES showed a particle size of 364.83 Â± 45.84 nm. The entrapment efficiency of the optimized formulation is found as 95.06 Â± 2.51%. Hemolysis data indicated that APES does not cause any significant hemolysis. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug release studies were carried out using dialysis membrane technique and the amount of drug released from APES &amp; APEG is found to be 95% and 94.21% respectively after 5 and6 hours. Kinetic data analysis revealed that APES &amp; APEG follows first order and zero order release kinetics, respectively. The anti-inflammatory activity studies of the formulation are done by estimating its inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase II (COX) II, lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS) &amp; cellular nitrite level using RAW 264.7 cells. The significant inhibition in the activities of the enzymes implies the anti-inflammatory activity of the formulations. Skin permeation study was carried out using porcine skin and revealed that the permeation of alpha phellandrene is increased from APES &amp; APEG when compared with alpha-phellandrene solution (APS). Skin deposition study of APS, APES &amp; APEG revealed better drug deposition from APEG (48.799 Â± 1.547Âµg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ) after 24 hours when compared with APS &amp; APES. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Overall results indicate that the ethosomal formulation of alpha phellandrene through transdermal route is an effective alternative for oral use of the drug.">

It is a challenging pathogen presenting a constant threat to flax production industry worldwide. Previously, we reported chromosome-level assemblies of 5 highly pathogenic &lt;i&gt;F. oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; f. sp. &lt;i&gt;lini&lt;/i&gt; strains. We sought to characterize the genomic architecture of the fungus and outline evolutionary mechanisms shaping the pathogen genome. Here, we reveal the complex multi-compartmentalized genome organization and uncover its diverse evolutionary dynamics, which boosts genetic diversity and facilitates host adaptation. In addition, our results suggest that host of functions implicated in the life cycle of mobile genetic elements are main contributors to dissimilarity between proteomes of different &lt;i&gt;Fusaria&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, our experiments demonstrate that mobile genetics elements are expressed in planta upon infection, alluding to their role in pathogenicity. On the whole, these results pave the way for further in-depth studies of evolutionary forces shaping the host-pathogen interaction.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Maize (Zea mays L.) is a major cereal crop, with the United States accounting for over 40% of the worldwide production. Corn leaf aphid [CLA; Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch)] is an economically important pest of maize and several other monocot crops. In addition to feeding damage, CLA acts as a vector for viruses that cause devastating diseases in maize. We have shown previously that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides heightened resistance to CLA. However, the transcriptomic variation conferring CLA resistance to Mp708 has not been investigated.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, we contrasted the defense responses of the resistant Mp708 genotype to those of the susceptible Tx601 genotype at the transcriptomic (mRNA-seq) and volatile blend levels. Our results suggest that there was a greater transcriptomic remodeling in Mp708 plants in response to CLA infestation compared to the Tx601 plants. These transcriptomic signatures indicated an activation of hormonal pathways, and regulation of sesquiterpenes and terpenoid synthases in a constitutive and inducible manner. Transcriptomic analysis also revealed that the resistant Mp708 genotype possessed distinct regulation of ethylene and jasmonic acid pathways before and after aphid infestation. Finally, our results also highlight the significance of constitutive production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Mp708 and Tx601 plants that may contribute to maize direct and/or indirect defense responses.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study provided further insights to understand the role of defense signaling networks in Mp708's resistance to CLA.">

        <span class="abst" title="Bacterial cellulose is one of the most promising biomaterials for the development of a wide array of novel biotechnological solutions. Nevertheless, the commercial production of bacterial cellulose is still a challenge and obtaining novel strains presenting increased cellulose biosynthesis and stress resistance properties is of extreme importance. This work demonstrates the increased stress resistance, cellulose production abilities, and overall genomic properties of &lt;i&gt;Komagataeibacter uvaceti&lt;/i&gt; FXV3, a novel cellulose-producing and stress resistant strain isolated from a fermented grape must. &lt;i&gt;K. uvaceti&lt;/i&gt; FXV3 was able to grow under several stress conditions, including the presence of high concentrations of ethanol (up to 7.5 % v/v), a trait that is not observed in the model strain &lt;i&gt;K. xylinus&lt;/i&gt; CECT 7351&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;K. uvaceti&lt;/i&gt; FXV3 produced increased concentrations of cellulose (4.31 mg/mL, 7 days after inoculation-DAI) when compared to &lt;i&gt;K. xylinus&lt;/i&gt; CECT 7351&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; (1.42 mg/mL, 7 DAI). Moreover, the detailed analysis of strain FXV3 genome revealed the presence of several genes involved in cellulose and acetan biosynthesis, quorum-sensing and quenching mechanisms, carbohydrate, amino acid, alcohol and aldehyde metabolism, as well as several other genes involved in stress resistance. Additionally, comparative genomic analysis revealed the increased prevalence of stress resistance genes in &lt;i&gt;K. uvaceti&lt;/i&gt; FXV3 when compared to &lt;i&gt;K. xylinus&lt;/i&gt; CECT 7351&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. Ultimately, this study reveals the increased biotechnological potential of &lt;i&gt;K. uvaceti&lt;/i&gt; FXV3 and brings new insights into the genetics behind &lt;i&gt;Komagataeibacter&lt;/i&gt; stress resistance and cellulose production abilities.">

Previous studies have shown that hop yield and bitter acid content decline with increased temperatures and low-water stress. We looked at physiological traits and differential gene expression in leaf, stem, and root tissue from hop (Humulus lupulus) cv. USDA Cascade in plants exposed to high temperature stress, low-water stress, and a compound treatment of both high temperature and low-water stress for six weeks. The stress conditions imposed in these experiments caused substantial changes to the transcriptome, with significant reductions in the expression of numerous genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Of the genes involved in bitter acid production, the critical gene valerophenone synthase (VPS) experienced significant reductions in expression levels across stress treatments, suggesting stress-induced lability in this gene and/or its regulatory elements may be at least partially responsible for previously reported declines in bitter acid content. We also identified a number of transcripts with homology to genes shown to affect abiotic stress tolerance in other plants that may be useful as markers for breeding improved abiotic stress tolerance in hop. Lastly, we provide the first transcriptome from hop root tissue.">

It affects all citrus species and cultivars regardless of the rootstock used, and despite intensive research in the last decades, there is no effective cure to control either the bacterial species (&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter spp.) or their insect vectors (&lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trioza erytreae&lt;/i&gt;). Currently, the best attempts to manage HLB are based on three approaches: (i) reducing the psyllid population by intensive insecticide treatments; (ii) reducing inoculum sources by removing infected trees, and (iii) using nursery-certified healthy plants for replanting. The economic losses caused by HLB (decreased fruit quality, reduced yield, and tree destruction) and the huge environmental costs of disease management seriously threaten the sustainability of the citrus industry in affected regions. Here, we have generated genetically modified sweet orange lines to constitutively emit (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Î²-caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene repellent to &lt;i&gt;D. citri&lt;/i&gt;, the main HLB psyllid vector.

        <span class="abst" title="Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and approximately 87% of cases are attributed to ischemia. The main factors that cause ischemic stroke include excitotoxicity, energy metabolism disorder, Ca&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, oxidative damage, apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation. However, no effective drug is currently available for the comprehensive treatment of ischemic stroke in clinical applications; thus, there is an urgent need to find and develop comprehensive and effective drugs to treat postischemic stroke. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has unique advantages in treating ischemic stroke, with overall regulatory effects at multiple levels and on multiple targets. Many researchers have studied the effective components of TCMs and have achieved undeniable results. This paper reviews studies on the anticerebral ischemia effects of TCM monomers such as tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), tanshinone IIA (TSA), gastrodin (Gas), and baicalin (BA) as well as effective extracts such as &lt;i&gt;Ginkgo biloba&lt;/i&gt; extract (EGB). Research on the anticerebral ischemia effects of TCMs has focused mostly on their antioxidative stress, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic, and proneurogenic effects. However, the research on the use of TCM to treat ischemic stroke remains incompletely characterized. Thus, we summarized and considered this topic from the perspective of pharmacokinetics, pharmacological effects, and mechanistic research, and we have provided a reference basis for future research and development on anticerebral ischemia TCM drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) is one of the oldest cultivated plants purported to have unique medicinal properties. However, scientific research of cannabis has been restricted by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, an international treaty that prohibits the production and supply of narcotic drugs except under license. Legislation governing cannabis cultivation for research, medicinal and even recreational purposes has been relaxed recently in certain jurisdictions. As a result, there is now potential to accelerate cultivar development of this multi-use and potentially medically useful plant species by application of modern genomics technologies. Whilst genomics has been pivotal to our understanding of the basic biology and molecular mechanisms controlling key traits in several crop species, much work is needed for cannabis. In this review we provide a comprehensive summary of key cannabis genomics resources and their applications. We also discuss prospective applications of existing and emerging genomics technologies for accelerating the genetic improvement of cannabis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Streptomyces niveus SCSIO 3406 was isolated from a sediment sample collected from South China Sea at a depth of 3536 m. Four new sesquiterpenoid naphthoquinones, marfuraquinocins A-D, and two new geranylated phenazines, i. e. phenaziterpenes A and B, were isolated from the fermentation broth of the strain. Here, we present its genome sequence, which contains 7,990,492 bp with a G+C content of 70.46% and harbors 7088 protein-encoding genes. The genome sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 28,787 bp gene cluster encoding for 24 open reading frames including 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase and monooxygenase, seven phenazine biosynthesis proteins, two prenyltransferases and a squalene-hopene cyclase. These genes are known to be necessary for the biosynthesis of both marfuraquinocins and phenaziterpenes. Outside the gene cluster (and scattered around the genome), there are seven genes belonging to the methylerythritol phosphate pathway for the biosynthesis of the essential primary metabolite, isopentenyl diphosphate, as well as six geranyl diphosphate/farnesyl diphosphate synthase genes. The strain S. niveus SCSIO 3406 showed type I PKS, type III PKS and nonribosomal peptide synthetase cluster. The sequence will provide the genetic basis for better understanding of biosynthesis mechanism of the above mentioned six compounds and for the construction of improved strain for the industrial production of antimicrobial agents.">

Transferring momilactone production to other crops is a potential approach to combat weeds, yet a complete momilactone biosynthetic pathway remains elusive. Here, we address this challenge through rapid gene screening in Nicotiana benthamiana, a heterologous plant host. This required us to solve a central problem: diminishing intermediate and product yields remain a bottleneck for multistep diterpene pathways. We increased intermediate and product titers by rerouting diterpene biosynthesis from the chloroplast to the cytosolic, high-flux mevalonate pathway. This enabled the discovery and reconstitution of a complete route to momilactones (&gt;10-fold yield improvement in production versus rice). Pure momilactone B isolated from N. benthamiana inhibited germination and root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, validating allelopathic activity. We demonstrated the broad utility of this approach by applying it to forskolin, a Hedgehog inhibitor, and taxadiene, an intermediate in taxol biosynthesis (~10-fold improvement in production versus chloroplast expression).">
