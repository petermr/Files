Scooping through TPS Volatile compounds Corpus:

I queried https://europepmc.org/ for following search   "terpene synthase TPS plant volatile compounds". 

I retrieved 312 Research articles, however **only 188 mention both TPS & volatile compounds**. I then skimmed important points from those 188 papers into csv table "tps compounds.csv"

This csv table contain link for papers, PMCID, plant name, 3 key points and availability of Supplementary file for compounds/TPS.
