Their role is generally unknown, the power of comparative genomics is huge and will become increasingly important as more genomes are sequenced. For fungi in general and  Dothideomycetes in particular the field is ascending rapidly. Several other  Dothideomycetes have been sequenced or are in progress and will provide greater representation of the extensive pathogenic and ecological diversity in this largest class of fungi. Completion of the 1000 Fungal Genomes project ( http://jgi.doe.gov/fungi) at the US DOE Joint Genome Institute plus numerous genomes sequenced through other initiatives provide a huge wealth of virtually untapped resources for future progress in understanding fungal biology and evolution. There are large variations in genome size between the  Dothideomycetes, which can be largely explained by the repetitive content of the individual genomes. Chromosome structural evolution in this class of fungi proceeds largely by intra-chromosomal rearrangements. A gradient of synteny from macro- to mesosynteny was observed in comparisons between species depending on evolutionary distance and agreed with simulation analyses of chromosomal evolution by frequent inversions. The high rate of inversions may be facilitated by the occurrence of simple repeats at the boundaries of inverted segments. Whether this phenomenon of frequent inversions is fortuitous or has been selected for to allow for rapid rates of evolution is not known. Gene order has not been completely reshuffled by these inversions, since blocks of genes with conserved order have been identified across  Dothideomycetes. Their function and the reason for their conservation are currently unknown, but the observation that in one case in  L. maculans all the genes in one conserved block of genes are up-regulated during plant infection suggests that co-regulation may be an important factor in pathogenesis. We have shown that genes for effector proteins, occur often in close proximity to transposable elements (TEs) in several  Dothideomycetes. TEs are frequently a target of Repeat Induced Point (RIP) mutations

In wintersweet, abundant volatiles were present in glycosidically bound forms, such as linalool glucoside," is related to the volatile glucosylation."""," Background Wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox), an important ornamental plant, has evolved unique fragrant aroma and winter-flowering properties, which are critical for its successful sexual reproduction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits are largely unknown in this species. In addition, wintersweet is also a typical representative species of the magnoliids, where the phylogenetic position of which relative to eudicots and monocots has not been conclusively resolved. Results Here, we present a chromosome-level wintersweet genome assembly with a total size of 695.36â€‰Mb and a draft genome assembly of Calycanthus chinensis. Phylogenetic analyses of 17 representative angiosperm genomes suggest that Magnoliids and eudicots are sister to monocots. Whole-genome duplication signatures reveal two major duplication events in the evolutionary history of the wintersweet genome, with an ancient one shared by Laurales, and a more recent one shared by the Calycantaceae. Whole-genome duplication and tandem duplication events have significant impacts on copy numbers of genes related to terpene and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (the main floral scent volatiles) biosynthesis, which may contribute to the characteristic aroma formation. An integrative analysis combining cytology with genomic and transcriptomic data reveals biological characteristics of wintersweet, such as floral transition in spring, floral organ specification, low temperature-mediated floral bud break, early blooming in winter, and strong cold tolerance. Conclusions These findings provide insights into the evolutionary history of wintersweet and the relationships among the Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots; the molecular basis underlying floral scent biosynthesis; and winter flowering, and highlight the utility of multi-omics data in deciphering important ornamental traits in wintersweet.","Genome', 'Cold tolerance', 'Flowering', 'Floral Scent', 'Hi-c', 'Wintersweet (Chimonanthus Praecox)'","Additional file', 'Additional', 'Fig.', 'file', 'genes', 'wintersweet', 'Table', 'wintersweet genome', 'genome', 'gene'"," Evolution of terpene biosynthesis and regulation-related genes The available genome assembly allows for  CpTPSs to be localized to either chromosomes or scaffold positions to consider a genomic context', ' The  CpTPS genes are not uniformly distributed throughout the chromosomes with 44 genes located on six chromosomes and eight genes on seven scaffolds (Fig', ' Fourteen of the 52  CpTPS genes have at least two copies and each duplicated gene copy was located adjacent to the other', ' For example,  CpTPS4 is located on scaffold662 and has three copies including  CpTPS17,  CpTPS18, and  CpTPS19', ' These three genes were arranged as a tandem array on chromosome 6 and highly expressed at the full open flower stage, which may have a similar function as  CpTPS4 and contribute equally to linalool production', ' Terpene synthases (TPSs) are the enzymes responsible for the last catalytic reaction in the MVA and MEP pathway to generate terpenoid compounds', ' With the aid of the assembly genome, a total of 52 complete  CpTPSs were identified (Additional file  1: Table S19), the number of which is approximately double that detected by transcriptomics in our previous study  5', ' Phylogenetic analysis of TPS from four species revealed that  CpTPSs were clustered into five of six subfamilies described for land plants (Fig', ' The majority of  CpTPSs were placed in the TPS-a (18) and TPS-b (24) subfamilies, which is predominantly composed of angiosperm-specific sesquiterpene and monoterpene synthases respectively  44', ' Comparative genomics analysis revealed that the TPS genes are significantly expanded, especially in the TPS-b subfamily (Fig', ' These lineage-specific gene expansions in the TPS-b subfamily may contribute to the monoterpene accumulation in floral VOCs in wintersweet', '  Expression analysis of the 52  CpTPS genes by RNA-seq revealed that six genes displayed similar expression patterns with the emission of major monoterpenes (Fig', ' Based on the expression pattern and phylogenetic analysis, we further selected three genes from TPS-b/g subfamily for functional characterization and found that all the genes encoded versatile enzymes with multiple products (Fig', ' Subcellular localization analysis showed that  CpTPS4 and  CpTPS9 were localized to the plastid whereas  CpTPS42 was targeted to the cytosol (Additional file  2: Fig', '  CpTPS42 was shown to be a sesquiterpene synthase, which mainly catalyzed the formation of nerolidol, together with other sesquiterpenes (Fig', '  CpTPS4 and  CpTPS9 are both monoterpene synthases and produce Î_-pinene and linalool as its main product respectively (Fig', ' To further understand the function of  CpTPS4, we also overexpressed the gene in tobacco', ' These results indicated that  CpTPS4 plays a primary role in the biosynthesis of linalool, the main components of floral scent', ' Terpenoid formation does not only depend on the biochemical properties of enzymes encoded by  CpTPS genes but also requires the involvement of transcription factors (TFs)', ' When screening the 2000-bp regions upstream of the 52  CpTPS genes, several defense and stress responsive elements were found to be significantly enriched, such as bHLH- and MYB-binding elements (Additional file  2: Fig', ' The results indicated that the MYB/bHLH transcription factors may serve as key factors in regulating the  CpTPS genes expression and provide us with the starting point for the further studies to reveal the cross-talk in the regulation of plant secondary metabolites and stress responses'"

Further analysis of ethyl acetate extracts of Cvi plants revealed the presence of dolabelladienol as another enzymatic product of TPS20c ( Figure   4B)', ' Hence, TPS20c was demonstrated to be

being almost identical. The same trend was observed for BLAST+ and MUMmer percent G+C differences. GGDC MUMmer dDDH values reflected changes relative to the control when sections of the genome were removed; however, while the distance values increase with the corresponding increases in deletion, the dDDH values remained the same at 99.3%. These experiments demonstrate different programs may or may not account for genetic differences such as HGT within the system of interest; the extent to which these differences are represented is unknown. This again highlights the fact that multiple analyses should be performed in order to ensure accurate statements are made regarding the relatedness of organisms being studied.  ANI calculator: ANI values were compared between all strain genomes tested using the ANI calculator ( Table S15). ANI values produced by the ANI calculator were over 99.99% for all strain comparisons, reinforcing the population designations. Based on ANI values, RT-II and RT-III appear most closely related, as does RT-I and RT-IV. RT-V appears most closely related to RT-III and then RT-II; RT-V was most distantly related to RT-IV. This data is highly similar to that from pan-genome analyses. The ANI calculator data output includes a phylogenetic tree, which was imported into Geneious for tree generation ( Figure 3). The phylogenetic tree produced from ANI distances shows the same trend; RT-II and RT-III are most closely related, while RT-I and RT-IV are most closely related. The web-interface for the ANI calculator also produces phylogenetic trees based on the NJ ( Figure S5A)  112

Terpene synthases (TPSs) are the key enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of terpenes. Although some species were employed for the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family, limited information is available regarding the evolution, expansion, and retention mechanisms occurring in this gene family. We performed a genome-wide identification of the TPS family members in 50 sequenced genomes. Additionally, we also characterized the TPS family from aromatic spearmint and basil plants using RNA-Seq data. No TPSs were identified in algae genomes but the remaining plant species encoded various numbers of the family members ranging from 2 to 79 full-length TPSs. Some species showed lineage-specific expansion of certain subfamilies, which might have contributed toward species or ecotype divergence or environmental adaptation. A large-scale family expansion was observed mainly in dicot and monocot plants, which was accompanied by frequent domain loss. Both tandem and segmental duplication significantly contributed toward family expansion and expression divergence and played important roles in the survival of these expanded genes. Our data provide new insight into the TPS family expansion and evolution and suggest that TPSs might have originated from isoprenyl diphosphate synthase genes.","['Evolution', 'Terpene synthase',

TPS enzymes In the following sections we describe the specific functional characterization of the 21 spruce TPSs (Figure  1)', ' With one exception, each of these TPSs only made significant use of one of the substrates', ' Based upon functional characterization, the 21 TPSs comprised 15 monoterpene synthases, 4 sesquiterpene synthases, and 2 diterpene synthases', ' The product identities and abundance for each TPS, including quantitative composition of multi-product profiles, is shown in Table  2, and representative GCMS traces are shown in Figures  2,  3, and  4', ' Results of the functional TPS characterization are discussed in the context of previously reported terpenoid metabolite profiles in Sitka spruce genotype FB3-425 see Supplemental Tables in  29, from which many of the functionally characterized TPS FLcDNAs were isolated', ' Most previously described conifer TPSs are multi-product enzymes  14, 18, and because the identity and relative abundance of TPS products are very sensitive to small changes in amino acid sequence  19- 24, it is not possible to accurately predict function based solely upon amino acid sequence similarity/phylogeny', ' While it might be possible to infer a TPS gene function from the chemical phenotype of a corresponding plant mutant, the genetic resources for such an approach are available only for a very few model systems such as Arabidopsis  25', ' Instead, in most systems, the functional annotation of each TPS requires expression and enzyme characterization of recombinant protein', ' Recombinant spruce TPSs were expressed in  E', ' Since two recent reports described the occurrence and conversion of  cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates in tomato  26- 28, we also assessed if spruce is likely to produce these additional TPS substrates', ' Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases: (-)-Linalool synthases We characterized two new (-)-linalool synthases in Sitka spruce (PsTPS-Lin-1 and PsTPS-Lin-2) and one in white spruce (PgTPS-Lin) (Tables  2 and  3, Figure  2)', ' Within the TPS-d1 clade, the Sitka spruce and white spruce (-)-linalool synthases formed a group of orthologous genes with the previously cloned Norway spruce (-)-linalool synthase (PaTPS-Lin)  14 (Figure  1)', ' They shared 86 to 98% amino acid sequence identity, with Sitka spruce PsTPS-Lin1 and white spruce PgTPS-Lin being the most closely related', ' Transcripts detected with a PaTPS-Lin probe were strongly induced in needles of MeJA-treated Sitka spruce  29', ' Phylogeny of gymnosperm TPSs In contrast to the many duplicated TPS-d genes of terpenoid specialized metabolism, the related spruce TPS genes of general gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis, specifically  ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (TPS-c) and  ent-kaurene synthase (TPS-e), appear to be expressed as single copy genes  12', ' These primary metabolism TPS genes are basal to the specialized metabolism genes and are the descendants of an ancestral plant diterpene synthase similar to the one found in the non-vascular plant  Physcomitrella patens  12, 48', ' The mechanisms that suppress manifestation or retention of TPS gene duplication in diterpenoid primary metabolism and those that enhance TPS gene duplication and functional diversification in specialized metabolism in a conifer genome are not known but are worthy of future investigation', ' The high functional plasticity of the TPS-d family and the great diversity of terpenoids produced may impart fitness advantages against a multitude of pests and pathogens', ' We speculate that the TPS-d genes of specialized metabolism originating from gene duplication are slower, or less likely, to become inactive pseudogenes compared to those genes with less functional plasticity in primary metabolism', ' All known conifer TPSs of specialized (i', ', secondary) metabolism are members of the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily, which is a distinct clade of the larger plant TPS gene family  47', ' The TPS-d subfamily has been subdivided into three clades TPS-d1 through TPS-d3 based on a previous phylogeny of 29 gymnosperm TPSs  14', ' Here, we have substantially expanded the phylogeny of functionally characterized gymnosperm TPSs to a total of 72 members (Figure  1), of which 41 are from spruce species with 20 different TPSs from Sitka spruce', ' The number of TPSs functionally characterized in Sitka spruce is one of the largest for any species, but is not yet approaching our  in silico minimum estimate for the number of TPSs in a spruce genome (at least 69 transcriptionally active TPS genes)', ' The diverse set of newly characterized spruce TPSs broadly represent the major TPS-d1, TPS-d2 and TPS-d3 clades, and allowed us to identify groups of likely orthologous TPS genes across the spruce species', ' Examples for such groups of orthologous TPSs in the TPS-d1 clade are the (-)-Î±/Î_-pinene synthases, the (-)-linalool synthases, ( E, E)-Î±-farnesene synthases; in the TPS-d2 clade are the longifolene synthases; and in the TPS-d3 clade are the levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthases and isopimaradiene synthases', ' In the TPS-d3 group of conifer diterpene synthases, the basal function of a multi-product levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase had apparently evolved prior to conifer speciation, as this function exists in a group of closely related genes from the genera  Abies,  Pinus and  Picea', ' Overall, the large diversity of gene functions among the many closely related genes of the conifer TPS-d1 group illustrates the many events of gene duplications and sub- or neo-functionalizations that have occurred in the evolution of this amazing family of conifer genes of specialized metabolism', ' The functionally identified spruce TPS genes account for many of the major and minor terpenoid compounds of the defensive oleoresin and volatile emissions', ' However, there are several distinct types of TPSs still to be found in spruce based upon the terpenoid components identified in oleoresin', ' Based on the current phylogeny of functionally characterized spruce TPSs, we predict that most of the remaining TPSs to be identified will be highly similar in sequence to previously identified TPS, but with the possibility of diverse function due to relatively minor sequence divergence', ' Functional characterization of sesquiterpene synthases PgTPS-Hum, PgÃ—eTPS-Lonf, PsTPS-Lonp belong to the TPS-d2 clade of the gymnosperm TPS-d subfamily, together with other conifer multi-product sesquiterpene synthases (Figure  1)', ' The hybrid white spruce PgÃ—eTPS-Far/Oci appeared to be orthologous with farnesene synthases from loblolly pine and Norway spruce in the TPS-d1 clade', ' For the three spruce species of our EST analysis, we cloned and functionally characterized four FLcDNAs, PgTPS-Hum, PgÃ—eTPS-Lonf, PsTPS-Lonp, and PgÃ—eTPS-Far/Oci, as  bona fide sesquiterpene synthases (Tables  2 and  3; Figure  3)', ' PgTPS-Hum, PgÃ—eTPS-Lonf, PsTPS-Lonp only used FPP as substrate and were typical multi-product conifer sesquiterpene synthases such as those first identified in grand fir  18', ' In contrast, PgÃ—eTPS-Far/Oci was active both with GPP and FPP', ' PgTPS-Hum produced predominantly Î±-humulene (approximately 43%) and ( E)-Î_-caryophyllene (approximately 38%), along with several minor products, similar to the Î±-humulene synthase previously characterized in Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris)  45', ' PgÃ—eTPS-Lonf produced longifolene (approximately 70%) and Î±-longipinene (approximately 30%)', ' Unlike the longifolene synthase from Norway spruce  14, this TPS did not produce other minor products', ' Sitka spruce PsTPS-Lonp produced predominantly Î±-longipinene (approximately 48%) but also substantial amounts of longifolene, Î_-himachalene, and other minor products', ' Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases: 1,8-Cineole synthases In each of the three spruce species studied we identified and characterized a single 1,8-cineole synthase, PgTPS-Cin, PgÃ—eTPS-Cin, and PsTPS-Cin (Tables  2 and  3, Figure  2)', ' The three enzymes shared approximately 99% sequence identity to each other and form a distinct group in the TPS-d1 clade most closely related to the linalool synthases', ' All three 1,8-cineole synthases were multi-product enzymes with the amount of the major 1,8-cineole product varying from approximately 60% of total product for PsTPS-Cin to approximately 90% for PgTPS-Cin', ' Although 1,8-cineole has been identified as a monoterpenoid component in needles and MeJA-induced volatile emissions of Norway spruce  37, and has recently been shown to inhibit attraction in the field and response of an olfactory receptor neuron to pheromone of a spruce beetle  43, this is the first characterization of gymnosperm TPSs that produce this compound', ' Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases: (+)-3-Carene synthases We recently identified a small clade of (+)-3-carene synthases and sabinene synthases in two genotypes of Sitka spruce that are resistant genotype H898; PsTPS-car1(R), PsTPS-car2(R), and PsTPS-sab(R) or susceptible genotype Q903; PsTPS-car1(S), PsTPS-car3(S), and PsTPS-sab(S) to white pine weevil,  Pissodes strobi  41', ' Here, we identified two additional (+)-3-carene synthases, one in a different genotype of Sitka spruce (genotype FB3-425; PsTPS-Car1), and one in hybrid white spruce (PgÃ—eTPS-Car1) (Tables  2 and  3, Figure  2)', ' These two (+)-3-carene synthases shared approximately 99% amino acid identity to each other, and were likely the orthologues of the (+)-3-carene synthases PsTPS-car1(R) and PsTPS-car1(S) recently described (Figure  1)', ' Despite the similarity of product profiles, the Sitka spruce and hybrid white spruce (+)-3-carene synthase both shared only 84% percent amino acid sequence identity with the Norway spruce TPS', ' Functional characterization of diterpene synthases The sequences of PsTPS-LAS and PaTPS-LAS differed by only 12 amino acids, and PsTPS-Iso and PaTPS-Iso differed by only 35 amino acids', ' In a detailed investigation of the PaTPS-LAS and PaTPS-Iso enzymes, using reciprocal site-directed mutagenesis and domain-swapping, we have recently shown that four amino acid residues determine the different product profiles of these Norway spruce diterpene synthases  24', ' These product-determining residues are identical between the levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthases (PsTPS-LAS and PaTPS-LAS) in Sitka and Norway spruce, consistent with their similar product profiles', ' However, only three of these residues are identical between the isopimaradiene synthases (PsTPS-Iso and PaTPS-Iso) in Sitka and Norway spruce; the fourth residue (V732) is the same as that found in the Norway spruce levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase', ' In our previous study  24, the corresponding reciprocal L725V mutation obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of PaTPS-Iso resulted in the formation of sandaracopimaradiene as a minor product', ' This product profile change is consistent with the new observation that the isopimaradiene synthase from Sitka spruce (PsTPS-Iso) naturally produced sandaracopimaradiene as a minor compound (Table  2, Figure  4)', ' Overall, these results highlight how mutations produced in the laboratory that determine product profile differences also exist in nature and do result in the evolution of altered TPS product profiles between species or genotypes', ' Two paralogous diterpene synthases, PsTPS-LAS and PsTPS-Iso, were characterized in Sitka spruce (Tables  2 and  3, Figure  4)', ' These TPSs shared 90% identity and they are the orthologues of levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase (PaTPS-LAS) and isopimaradiene synthase (PaTPS-Iso) from Norway spruce  14 (Figure  1)', ' They belong to the TPS-d3 clade of the gymnosperm TPS-d family', ' PsTPS-LAS produced a similar multi-product profile as its ortholog in Norway spruce, composed of abietadiene (49%), levopimaradiene (24%), neoabietadiene (23%), and palustradiene (4%)', ' In contrast to the single-product isopimaradiene synthase from Norway spruce  14, Sitka spruce PsTPS-Iso produced minor amounts of sandaracopimaradiene (2%) in addition to isopimaradiene (98%) (Table  2, Figure  4)', ' PsTPS-Iso is the first gymnosperm TPS identified to naturally produce sandaracopimaradiene, albeit in minor amounts', ' PsTPS-LAS and PsTPS-Iso play an important role in the overall diterpene resin acid defence systems of Sitka spruce', ' Accumulation of all of these diterpene resin acids was induced by MeJA treatment or insect attack, along with increased transcript levels detected with the orthologous PaTPS-LAS and PaTPS-Iso probes  29', ' Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases: (-)-Î±/Î_-pinene synthases In contrast to the white spruce enzymes PgTPS-Pin-1 and PgTPS-Pin-2, the newly characterized Sitka spruce PsTPS-Pin enzyme produced a larger proportion of (-)-Î_-pinene (more than 80%) and lesser amounts of (-)-Î±-pinene (less than 13%), but also had four additional minor products not observed with the PgTPS-Pin enzymes (Table  2, Figure  2)', ' These comparisons of product profiles and ratios across a set of orthologous, or likely orthologous, multiproduct (-)-pinene synthases show that overall sequence relatedness is not a good indicator of the specific product profiles and ratios even for closely related TPS enzymes', ' We characterized one new (-)-Î±/Î_-pinene synthase in Sitka spruce (PsTPS-Pin) and two in white spruce (PgTPS-Pin-1 and PgTPS-Pin-2; both originating from the same genotype) (Tables  1 and  2)', ' These three enzymes clustered closely with the two previously characterized (-)-Î±/Î_-pinene synthases from Sitka spruce  32 and Norway spruce  14 in the TPS-d1 clade (Figure  1)', ' The two (-)-Î±/Î_-pinene synthases in white spruce (PgTPS-Pin-1 and PgTPS-Pin-2) contained only four amino acid differences: Q/R94, R/G217, S/N221, and E/G599, but showed an opposing pattern in the relative amounts of Î±- and Î_-pinene produced by the recombinant enzymes (67:33 and 29:71 Î±-pinene:Î_-pinene, respectively, Table  2)', ' One might hypothesize that the E/G599 difference was the origin of the observed product differences between the two white spruce PgTPS-Pin variants', ' Identification of unique TPS sequences and isolation of full-length TPS cDNA clones The  in silico analysis of 443,665 spruce ESTs identified a total of 506 ESTs corresponding to putative TPSs (Table  1)', ' Assembly of these ESTs into contigs and singlets allowed us to estimate the minimum number of actively expressed TPS genes in each of the three spruce species of our analysis', ' We identified 69 unique TPS sequences in white spruce, 55 in Sitka spruce, and 20 in hybrid white spruce', ' Although the rate of gene discovery was dependent on the depth of EST sequencing (Table  1), the substantially deeper EST sequence coverage in white spruce (242,931 ESTs) did not result in a proportional increase of TPS discovery relative to Sitka spruce (174,384 ESTs) and hybrid white spruce (26,350 ESTs), suggesting that the majority of expressed TPSs in the tissues sequenced were captured at the depth of sequencing probed in white spruce and Sitka spruce', ' The estimate of at least 69 TPSs in white spruce is comparable to the number of putatively active TPS genes found in the sequenced genomes of angiosperms and is perhaps a good approximation of the total number of transcriptionally active TPS genes in a conifer species', ' From the set of assembled TPS sequences, we examined approximately 170 of the corresponding cDNA clones by restriction digest, colony PCR and/or sequencing to identify those which contained full ORFs', ' In addition, three full-length TPS cDNA clones were obtained by RACE cloning or homology-based PCR cloning', ' As the Treenomix project  16, which generated the available cDNA clones focused its FLcDNA program on Sitka spruce, the majority of the full-length TPS cDNA clones were from this species (12 FLcDNAs)', ' Five full-length TPS cDNA clones originated from white spruce, and four from hybrid white spruce', ' Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases: (-)-Î_-phellandrene synthases We identified four (-)-Î_-phellandrene synthases in Sitka spruce (PsTPS-Phel-1, PsTPS-Phel-2, PsTPS-Phel-3, and PsTPS-Phel-4), which shared 99% amino acid identity with each other, suggesting that these genes represent nearly identical allelic variants or very recently duplicated genes in the two genotypes that they originated from (Table  3)'",terpene synthase

between the two  Freesia cultivars In plants, volatile terpenes originate from two distinct pathways, designated the MEP and the MVA pathway', ' In addition, almost all the candidate genes had similar expression levels between Red River Â® and Ambiance except several  TPS genes (nominated as  FhTPS genes)', ' Consequently, it was reasonable to speculate that the differentially expressed  FhTPS genes might produce the divergent volatile compound emissions from the flowers of the two  Freesia cultivars', ' Based on their floral expression levels, putative  FhTPS genes were further amplified', ' A total of eight  FhTPS genes were obtained, designated  FhTPS1â€“ FhTPS8', ' All eight  FhTPS genes were amplified from Red River Â® except  FhTPS7, and they were all also obtained from Ambiance with the exception of  FhTPS5', ' Several variations were found between FhTPS proteins from the two cultivars, although FhTPS1 showed identical amino acid sequences ( Supplementary Figs S3â€“S8)', ' As shown in  Supplementary Table S5, the  FhTPS1â€“ FhTPS8 ORF sequences encoded 592, 595, 590, 566, 607, 566, 570, and 566 deduced amino acids, respectively, and showed high sequence identities with TPS proteins from other species', ' In order to obtain the genomic sequences of the eight  FhTPS genes, specific primers ( Supplementary Table S1) were designed and amplified using genomic DNA of Red River Â® and Ambiance', ' Results showed that  FhTPS2,  FhTPS3, FhTPS4, and  FhTPS8 contained six introns,  FhTPS6 contained three introns, in both cultivars', ' In contrast,  FhTPS1 was found to have three introns in Red River Â®, whereas no intron was present in the corresponding gene in Ambiance', ' Furthermore, the genome sequence of  FhTPS5, which had three introns in Red River Â®, could not be isolated from Ambiance, and  FhTPS7 was obtained only from Ambiance, in which it had six introns ( Supplementary Fig', ' FhTPS genes show different expression patterns during ï¬‚ower development and in different tissues To compare the transcription of the  FhTPS genes with the patterns of volatile terpene release during ï¬‚ower development, floral development was divided into five stages as described in our previous studies ( Sun   et al', ' qRT-PCR was performed to investigate the temporal pattern of expression levels of the eight candidate  FhTPS genes during flower development', ' In agreement with the patterns of volatile terpene emission, the transcript levels of most of the  FhTPS genes substantially increased and were maintained at a high level during anthesis', ' In addition,  FhTPS1,  FhTPS2, and  FhTPS6 were highly expressed in Red River Â® ( Fig', ' S12), whereas  FhTPS1 and  FhTPS7 had higher expression levels in Ambiance ( Fig', ' To further investigate whether the expression patterns of  FhTPS genes coincided spatially with terpene emissions, flower tissue-specific expression patterns were also assessed ( Fig', ' qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of  FhTPS1 and  FhTPS2 in Red River Â®, and  FhTPS1 and  FhTPS7 in Ambiance, were significantly higher than the other  FhTPS genes in all the tested tissues', ' Furthermore, it was noteworthy that only  FhTPS4 showed a relatively high expression level in calyx and torus, indicating that it might be responsible for the biosynthesis and emission of terpenes in these two flower tissues', ' However, more detailed data are needed in order to decipher the catalytic properties of the FhTPS proteins', ' Functional characterization of major  FhTPS genes  in planta was consistent with production obtained  in vitro To further investigate whether the major  FhTPSs that are highly expressed in flowers of the two  Freesia cultivars yield the same terpene products  in vivo, they were transiently expressed in tobacco leaves', ' Specifically, FhTPS1 could catalyze the formation of linalool when overexpressed, whereas transformation with  FhTPS2 caused the significant production of Î±-terpineol', ' For the sesquiterpene synthases, FhTPS6 and FhTPS7, the major components of the enzymatic products  in vitro, that is, selinene and copaene, respectively, were detected in the transgenic tobacco leaves ( Fig', ' We also transformed  FhTPS3 and  FhTPS5 into tobacco; consistent with the biochemical analysis, no products were found to be synthesized or highly increased (data not shown), indicating that these two  FhTPS genes might be pseudofunctional or that their catalytic activities were too low to yield detectable products', ' Enzyme kinetic parameter analysis demonstrates that FPP is the preferred substrate for FhTPS7 in the cultivar Ambiance Regardless of linalool, more sesquiterpenes were released from flowers of Ambiance than from Red River Â®, and this might be ascribed to the higher expression of  FhTPS7 in Ambiance', ' However, biochemical analysis showed that FhTPS7 could synthesize monoterpenes using GPP and generate sesquiterpenes in the presence of FPP', ' Therefore, it was reasonable to deduce that the sesquiterpene production in Ambiance might be regulated by substrate selectivity of FhTPS7', ' In order to investigate this possible substrate bias, kinetic parameters of FhTPS7 were examined', ' A range of concentrations of GPP (3â€“270 Î_M) and FPP (1â€“135 Î_M) was employed to yield hyperbolic saturation curves; the results indicated that the recombinant FhTPS7 enzyme recognized FPP more efficiently (nearly 40-fold difference of  kcat/ Km) ( Table 2), which is in accordance with the expectations suggested above', ' Therefore, it may reasonably be concluded that the substrate preference of FhTPS7 protein plays an important role in determining the abundance of sesquiterpenes in Ambiance', ' Expression of  FhTPS genes is associated with the formation of volatile terpenes in the two cultivars of  Freesia x  hybrida As the major volatile terpene components released from flowers were well matched with the catalytic products of the FhTPS proteins encoded by the highly expressed  FhTPS genes, it is reasonable to deduce that their specific expression profiles might account for levels of metabolite biosynthesis and emission', ' In order to verify this hypothesis, the patterns of emission of the major volatile terpenes and the expression of  FhTPS genes were compared to determine any positive relationships', ' The release of linalool in flowers of both  Freesia cultivars was synchronized with the expression of  FhTPS1 in three flower tissues (petal, pistil, and stamen), whereas the expression of  FhTPS4 was only consistent with the release of linalool in calyx and torus', ' Expression of  FhTPS2 showed a synchronous relationship with the emission of Î±-terpineol in Red River Â®', '  FhTPS6 was also expressed in the two cultivars at relatively high levels', '  FhTPS7 was the  TPS gene with the highest expression in Ambiance, and its expression was obviously consistent with the emissions of sesquiterpene, especially copaene', '  FhTPS8 was expressed in Ambiance at a lower level, and its expression was found to be correlated with the release of another major sesquiterpene, Î±-gurjunene ( Fig', ' Finally, in order to confirm whether the correlation between the expression of the  FhTPS genes and the release of the major volatile terpenes was significant, Pearson correlation evaluation was performed, and significant values ( P<0', ' FhTPSs phylogenetically cluster into different subgroups with different amino acid motifs and divergent subcellular localization To further clarify the potential roles of the eight FhTPS proteins, a phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method', ' The results showed that TPS proteins from various species were clearly classified into six different clades, including clades TPS-c (most conserved among land plants), TPS-e/f (conserved among vascular plants), and TPS-d (gymnosperm specific), and three angiosperm-specific clades, TPS-b, TPS-g, and TPS-a ( Fig', ' The TPS-a clade was further divided into a dicot-specific subclade and a monocot-specific subclade', ' All the FhTPS proteins identified in the present study clustered into angiosperm-specific clades', ' In particular, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, and FhTPS8 clustered into the TPS-a monocot subclade together with other TPS proteins from monocot plant species', ' Other FhTPS proteins, including FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, and FhTPS5, fell into the TPS-b clade', ' By contrast, FhTPS4 clustered independently into the TPS-g clade', ' Sequence alignment revealed that all of the FhTPS proteins contained the conserved DDXX(D/E) and (N,D)DX2(S,T,G)X3E (NSE/DTE) regions that are essential for the binding of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ cofactors to catalyze terpene biosynthesis ( Supplementary Fig', ' Moreover, FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, and FhTPS5 also shared another conserved motif, RRX 8W, which is usually found in TPSs catalyzing the cyclization of monoterpenes', ', 2012 ) software predicted that FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS4, and FhTPS5 had transit peptides positioned upstream of the RRX 8W motif and therefore had a high probability of localizing in the plastids ( Supplementary Fig', ' This is consistent with the subcellular localization analysis, which showed that FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS4, and FhTPS5 were localized to the plastids, whereas FhTPS3, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, and FhTPS8 showed a diffuse cellular distribution ( Fig', ' Biochemical characterization of the enzymes encoded by  FhTPS genes revealed their versatile and diverse functions Catalytic activity analysis of the eight FhTPS proteins was also performed using FPP as substrate ( Table 1;  Supplementary Fig', ' Results showed that FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, and FhTPS5 did not have the ability to synthesize sesquiterpenes, whereas FhTPS4, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, and FhTPS8 had versatile roles in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes', ' Notably, GC-MS analysis of the products of the reactions catalyzed by FhTPS7 identified at least 24 kinds of sesquiterpenes, with copaene (37', ' FhTPS8 and FhTPS6 were also shown to be multiple-product sesquiterpene synthases, which mainly catalyzed the formation of Î±-gurjunene and selinene, respectively, together with other sesquiterpenes', ' For FhTPS4, only nerolidol could be identified as a sesquiterpene product', ' The predominant volatile terpenes in most flowers are monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, produced by pathways catalyzed by TPS proteins using GPP or FPP as substrate, respectively', ' To further confirm the enzymatic properties of the FhTPS proteins and their dominant roles in the biosynthesis of terpenes in  F', ' To prepare recombinant proteins for the biochemical analysis, the eight  FhTPS genes were expressed in  E', ' FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, and FhTPS8 were induced into the supernatant and then purified as homogenous soluble proteins, whereas FhTPS3, FhTPS4, and FhTPS5 were expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies, and so crude protein extracts were utilized in the assays of enzymatic activity ( Supplementary Fig', ' S15); although some FhTPS4 was detected in the supernatant, it failed to be purified', ' S16, upon incubation with GPP as a substrate, both FhTPS1 and FhTPS4 exclusively catalyzed the formation of linalool, as predicted above, whereas FhTPS2, FhTPS6, and FhTPS7 were confirmed to be versatile enzymes with multiple products', ' Specifically, FhTPS2 mainly converted GPP into Î±-terpineol (78', ' FhTPS6 primarily catalyzed the formation of myrcene (40', ' Similar to FhTPS6, FhTPS7 chiefly transformed GPP into the same monoterpenes with variable percentages, mainly myrcene (41', ' In contrast, no monoterpene was detected in assays using FhTPS3, FhTPS5, or FhTPS8 as

of finger citron TPSs from three Modules (Red, Green, and Blue) in biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids, although their functions need to be further investigated', ' Changes in Transcript Levels of TPS

volatile production, the terpene products of all DdTPSs except DdTPS8 could be validated by the detection of DdTPS products in the volatile bouquet of  D', ' Among all the volatile terpenes emitted from the two species, only one terpene is common: protoillud-7-ene, which is the product of the ortholog pair DpTPS1 and DdTPS6 in the clade 1 (Fig', ' Most  DpTPS genes showed dynamic expression

of gene family (TPSa-TPSe/f)', ' The Terzyme hidden markov models, in contrast, achieve taxon-based distinction between identified TPSs', ' One reason for the failure of general annotation databases may be that available programs like Pfam identify TPSs by detecting either the N-terminal domain naming them as Terpene_synth (PF01397) or the metal binding domain designating it as Terpene_synth_C

moth ( Lymantria dispar)-damaged  P', ' trichocarpa leaves, 15 open reading frames of  TPS genes could be amplified and cloned', ' Eleven of them represented poplar  TPS genes which have not been characterized and described before', ' Following the nomenclature of Danner and coworkers (2011), the genes were designated as  PtTPS5 to  PtTPS15 (Figure\xa0 1)', ' Based on their sequence similarity to so far characterized poplar TPS and representative TPS from other plant species (Additional file  1: Figure S4), the proteins encoded by  PtTPS5- 15 were tentatively classified as four monoterpene synthases (MTS) (PtTPS6, PtTPS12, PtTPS13, PtTPS15), six sesquiterpene synthases (STS) (PtTPS5, PtTPS7, PtTPS8, PtTPS9, PtTPS11, PtTPS14) and a diterpene synthase (DTS) (PtTPS10)', ' PtTPS5-15 all had a length between 550 to 840 amino acids (Additional file  2: Table S1) and contained typical conserved elements including the DDxxD motif and the NSE/DTE motifs (Additional file  1: Figure S5), both of which are involved in the binding of the metal cofactor  24', ' Interestingly, PtTPS11 and PtTPS14 possessed an altered NSE/DTE motif which contained a glycine residue instead of the serine/threonine', ' Another typical sequence motif, the RR (x) 8\u2009W motif in the N-terminal part was also changed and expressed as RP (x) 8\u2009W in PtTPS11 and PtTPS14 and was completely absent in PtTPS15', ' In PtTPS15, the RxR motif was modified to RxQ, which is also present in PtTPS3  21', ' TPS10, a putative diterpene synthase, showed an RxK motif at this position (Additional file  1: Figure S5, Additional file  2: Table S1)', ' A plastid transit peptide was predicted for PtTPS6, PtTPS12 and PtTPS13 (Additional file  2: Table S1) supporting their roles as MTS in plastids', ' However, no signal peptide could be predicted for the putative MTS PtTPS15 and the putative DTS PtTPS10', ' The  TPS gene family in  P', ' trichocarpa To identify the members of the  TPS gene family in  P', ' This analysis revealed 38 full length  TPS genes which encode for putative proteins with a minimal length of 520 amino acids including the previously published genes  PtTPS1- 4  21 (Figure\xa0 1)', ' Additionally, 19  TPS gene fragments were found in the database', ' Bacterial-like  TPSs as already described for  S', ' Six of the seven  TPS gene subfamilies were represented in the 38 complete poplar  TPSs (Additional file  1: Figure S1)  12', ' The  TPS- a subfamily with 16 members and the  TPS- b subfamily with 17 members made up the majority of poplar  TPSs, while only two members each fell into the  TPS- g,  TPS- c and the  TPS- e subfamilies and only one  TPS gene clustered within the  TPS- f subfamily', ' As the members of the  TPS- c and  TPS- e subfamily most likely represent copalyl diphosphate synthases and kaurene synthases (for conserved protein sequence motifs see Additional file  1: Figure S2), respectively, which are not involved in volatile biosynthesis, we did not focus on these in more detail in this study', ' The chromosomal position was assigned to 29 of the full-length  TPS genes, and these were found to be located on eleven of the nineteen poplar chromosomes', ' About one third of the  TPS genes and half of the  TPS gene fragments were found on chromosome 19, suggesting the occurrence of multiple duplication and recombination events on this chromosome (Additional file  1: Figure S3)', ' On other chromosomes, a maximum number of three  TPS genes were found', ' Nine  TPS genes and 4  TPS gene fragments were not linked to poplar chromosomes based on the new genome version', ' Therefore one could still expect changes in the actual numbers of poplar  TPS genes and their locations as newer versions of the poplar genome are released', ' As previously described, ( E)-Î_-ocimene, a monoterpene, and ( E, E)-Î±-farnesene, a sesquiterpene likely produced by the sesquiterpene synthase PtTPS2, were the most abundant volatiles (Figure\xa0 4)  21', ' TPS gene expression is affected by herbivory To analyze whether the expression of  PtTPS5- 15 is influenced by herbivory, the transcript abundance of these genes was measured using qRT-PCR in apical, herbivore-damaged leaves (LPI3, for a detailed description of leaf plastochron index (LPI) see material and methods) compared to the respective undamaged leaves from control trees', ' The expression levels of  PtTPS5- 15 generally increased after herbivore attack (Figure\xa0 3)', ' Six of these genes were slightly upregulated, about 2- to 8-fold, with the increases in transcript accumulation significant for  PtTPS9,  PtTPS10,  PtTPS12 and  PtTPS15 but not for  PtTPS5 and  PtTPS11/ 14 (Figure\xa0 3, Additional file  2: Table S2)', ' Repeated sequencing of amplicons from  PtTPS11/ 14-qRT-PCR reactions revealed a 1:4 ratio of  PtTPS11 to  PtTPS14 transcript', ' A larger significant induction could be shown for  PtTPS7 and  PtTPS13, with 24', '  PtTPS6 showed the strongest response to herbivore damage with a 44', ' No qRT-PCR analysis was performed for  PtTPS8 as no activity could be observed for the corresponding protein', ' Altogether the qRT-analysis showed distinct differences in the Î” Cq values ( CqTPS â€“  Cqhouse-keeping gene) for the identified  PtTPS genes (Additional file  2: Table S3)', '  PtTPS11/ 14 and  PtTPS12 had Î” Cq-values higher than 15 indicating low expression levels', ' In contrast, small Î” Cq-values were observed for  PtTPS6 and  PtTPS9 indicating higher transcript abundance compared to the other  PtTPS genes', ' The local and systemic emission of ( E)-Î_-ocimene and ( E)-Î_-caryophyllene can be correlated to the expression patterns of  PtTPS6 and  PtTPS9, respectively To determine whether local and systemic terpene emission pattern are reflected by  TPS gene expression, the transcript abundance of the ( E)-Î_-ocimene synthase PtTPS6 and the ( E)-Î_-caryophyllene synthase PtTPS9 were measured in gypsy moth-damaged leaves (LPI3 and LPI10), the closest neighboring leaves (LPI4 and LPI9, respectively) and the leaves to which they are most closely vascularly connected (LPI8 and LPI5, respectively)  27, 28', '  PtTPS6 gene expression was significantly increased in both herbivore-damaged LPI3 and LPI10 leaves', ' In contrast,  PtTPS9 was slightly induced in the apical LPI3 leaf and not induced in the basal LPI10 leaf (Figure\xa0 5, Additional file  2: Table S2, S6)', ' Altogether, transcript abundance of  PtTPS6 was strongly upregulated in herbivore-damaged leaves in comparison to the most adjacent leaves and vascularly connected leaves of the damaged tree as well as in comparison to all leaves measured on undamaged control trees', ' On the other hand,  PtTPS9 gene expression was hardly influenced by herbivory', ' No significant upregulation of  PtTPS9 transcripts in neighboring leaves or vascularly connected leaves could be detected (Figure\xa0 5, Additional file  2: Table S2, S6)', ' Heterologous expression and  in vitro functional characterization of poplar TPSs Four out of the 6 putative STS were able to convert FPP into different sesquiterpenes (Figure\xa0 2A)', ' PtTPS9 produced ( E)-Î_-caryophyllene and smaller amounts of Î±-humulene', ' In contrast, PtTPS11 showed a broader product spectrum comprising 18 different sesquiterpenes with Î_-elemene, eremophilene, Î±-selinene and an unidentified sesquiterpene representing the major peaks', ' Such complex product spectra could also be observed for PtTPS5, producing at least 27 different sesquiterpenes dominated by an unidentified sesquiterpene alcohol, and for PtTPS7 producing more than 15 different sesquiterpenes with elemol being the main product', ' Because the sesquiterpenes Î_-elemene (PtTPS11) and elemol (PtTPS7) are known to arise as thermal rearrangement products from germacrene A  25 and hedycaryol  26, respectively, during hot GC injection, the products of PtTPS7 and PtTPS11 were also analyzed using a colder GC injector (temperature, 150Â°C)', ' Although Î_-elemene and elemol were still present in the GC chromatograms, an expansion of the germacrene A peak (PtTPS11) and hedycaryol peak (PtTPS7) could be observed, demonstrating the genuine activity of these enzymes (Additional file  1: Figure S6)', ' In contrast to PtTPS5, PtTPS7, PtTPS9 and PtTPS11, the putative STS PtTPS14 showed only marginal activity with FPP and produced trace amounts of germacrene D (data not shown)', ' PtTPS8, however, produced no sesquiterpenes', ' When offered GPP as a substrate, PtTPS11 formed several monoterpenes including myrcene, limonene, terpinolene and linalool (Figure\xa0 2B)', ' Concerning the other STS, either trace activity (PtTPS5, PtTPS7, and PtTPS9) or no activity (PtTPS8, PtTPS14) was observed with GPP (data not shown)', ' As predicted, PtTPS10 represented a DTS and was able to convert GGPP into geranyllinalool', ' Neither GPP nor FPP was accepted by PtTPS10', ' None of the other TPSs was able to accept GGPP as substrate', ' For functional characterization of poplar TPS, all isolated  TPS genes were heterologously expressed in  Escherichia coli', ' To ensure that the predicted signal peptides did not interfere with expression, truncated versions of  PtTPS6 (Î”57nt),  PtTPS12 (Î”126nt) and  PtTPS13 (Î”126nt) were expressed', ' All putative MTS (PtTPS6, PtTPS12, PtTPS13 and PtTPS15) accepted GPP as substrate and produced monoterpenes (Figure\xa0 2B)', ' PtTPS6 formed ( E)-Î_-ocimene as the major product with minor amounts of ( Z)-Î_-ocimene', ' A similar narrow product specificity could also be observed for PtTPS15, which produced only linalool, and PtTPS12 which formed linalool and trace amounts of Î_-phellandrene, ( E)-Î_-ocimene and Î±-terpinolene', ' However, PtTPS13 made five monoterpenes including Î±-pinene, Î_-pinene, sabinene, 1,8-cineole and Î±-terpineol', ' The incubation of PtTPS6 and PtTPS13 with FPP revealed no product formation', ' In contrast, PtTPS12 showed a broad sesquiterpene product spectrum and produced at least 25 different sesquiterpenes with Î_-curcumene being the major one, and PtTPS15 was able to convert FPP to nerolidol (Figure\xa0 2A)', ' A chiral analysis demonstrated that PtTPS9 formed exclusively the (âˆ’)-enantiomer of ( E)-Î_-caryophyllene (Additional file  1: Figure

was made by PtTPS12 (Additional file  1: Figure S7D)', ' PtTPS11 formed (âˆ’)-Î_-elemene (Additional file  1: Figure S7E) which corresponds to (+)-germacrene A as the actual enzyme product because the

share complementary patterns of expansions and contractions in CAZymes ( Fig 7A) and PCWDEs ( Fig 7B) more specifically. Such coherent changes between  P.  eumusae and  P.  fijiensis in the size of gene families related to nutrient acquisition could reflect evolutionary changes that underlie a more effective exploitation of the banana host. Thus, in addition to parallel adaptations for nutrient utilization,  P.  eumusae and  P.  fijiensis seem to have evolved more similar mechanisms for nutrient acquisition as well. Taken together, although, given their differences at the individual CAZy family level, they may differ in the efficiency by which they hydrolyze different types of polysaccharides. Pairwise analyses of gene copy-number variations (CNV) indicate that  P.  fijiensis and  P.  eumusae share a parallel pattern of expansions and contractions in gene families that are associated with metabolism To further elucidate whether a causal relationship exists between CNV in genes involved in metabolism and the species virulence phenotypes, we performed hierarchical clustering based on the KOG distribution profiles (i.e. by enumerating the number of genes assigned to each category of KOG) of the species entire proteomes and compared it with the species hierarchical clustering based on the KOG distribution profiles of their core gene families with CNV. When clustering was performed using the species entire proteomes, with  P.  musae and  P.  eumusae clustering together as a monophyletic group ( Fig 6A). In contrast

oduce ta-siRNAs  [81] are conserved in several plant species, grape included. BLAST searches identified four Dicer-like proteins (Helicase, RNAse IIIa/b domains), indicating the presence in the grape genome of a complex RNA processing machinery ( Figure S5). Small nuclear RNA Non-coding RNAs include five major and four minor snRNA families, all components of splicing factors. The Arabidopsis snRNA list of Wang and Brendel  83 was used to search for similar sequences in grape. We found 89 snRNA genes and pseudogenes (75 in Arabidopsis) ( Table S11). Several snRNA genes were clustered in the genome. Several clusters of NBS genes mapped to chromosomal regions where genetic resistance to fungal diseases, such as downy and powdery mildew, were previously assigned ( Figure 3B). This included LGs 12 and 18  38 and LGs 14 and 15  27,  39. Thus

extensive analysis to uncover', ' Expression of endophytic TPSs in  E', '  coli To determine their function, the 26 predicted TPS genes were codon optimized and expressed in  E', ' This plasmid was used to increase the flux of carbon through the terpene pathway with the aim of enhancing productivity and increasing the chance that even poorly expressed TPS will produce detectable levels of
